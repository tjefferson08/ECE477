    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 02 SUMMARY</b><br>
                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Submitted final project proposal<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 1 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 9.5 hours</p>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 03</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>Completed Eagle tutorials and schematic design homework. This will be crucial to know and understand once the PCB board is being prototyped.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 29, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>Met as a team to begin prototying the Every1 DJ. Spent a few hours deciding what will be implemented and the main design aspects. It was decided that a Raspberry Pi will be used to interface with the web application. </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 1, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Updated Team 2 website with the PSSC's and links to the completed homeworks.</p>

    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 03 SUMMARY</b><br>
                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Keeping website updated and finalizing project contraints so that parts can get ordered in a timely fashion<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 5.5 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 15 hours</p>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 04</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 2, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Created the Google Doc for Homework 3. Did priliminary research for LED's, LCD's and microcontrollers.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 4, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>Finialized the design contraints for the microcontoller. Decided that around 100 I/O pins will be used for the LED's, and a shift register will not be needed to expand the I/O pins. SPI interfacing and ADC is also important to interface with the Raspberry Pi. The Every1 DJ will utilize a <a id="document_link" href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/70616g.pdf"> DSPIC33EP512MU814-I/PH-ND </a> microntroller. 

    <br><br>Realized that heat dissipation may become an issue if all components are housed within the same unit. The system may have to utilize a fan to keep all parts cool </br></br>

    <br> Completed parts of Homework 3, including the introduction, some design contraints, interface requirements, packaging contraints, microcontroller selection and block diagram. </br>

    <br><br>Below is the block diagram for our design: </br></br>

    <img src="../images/spouliqu/BlockDiagram.png" alt="screenshot1" height="500px" width="500px"></p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 5, 2014(1.5 hour)</b>:<br>Researched implementations of this design to see what has been used in the past. This includes packing selection, motor use, etc. The key is to determine how the disco ball and lights will be housed (i.e. a plexiglass sphere with LED's inside, a mirrored discoball with LED's on the outside, etc). Once this is finialized, parts can be ordered. </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 6, 2014(1.5 hour)</b>:<br>A final design was determined. LED's will be housed externally from the disco ball. This way there will be no worries of wires being tangeled. The mechanical design will mimic the design from this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnm_IXD6tNM . </br>

    <br> Because the mechanical design changed, and only 4 LED's will be used, the microcontroller constraints changed a little. It was determined by the team that the microcontroller needed the following properties: </br>

    <br>1. Two ADC's for audio sample</br> 
    <br>2. Around 20-40 I/O pins for LED's, LCD, push buttons</br>
    <br>3. Serial peripheral interfacing to interface with the Raspberry Pi</br>

    <br> From these specifications, and the availability of test boards in lab, it was detemined the the <a id="document_link" href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/39778e.pdf"> PIC18F87J11 </a> would suit the projects needs the best. This device has 68 I/O pins which gives the team enough leeway incase design changes happen throughout the project. This microcontroller is also available for checkout in lab, which makes inital prototyping simpler. </br></p>

                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Most parts selected and a final design selected.<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 7 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 22 hours</p>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 05</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 12, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Checked out the PIC microcontroller from Joe during mandatory lab session. Began downloading the software programs to begin programming the micro. Also, began looking into ordering parts for the design.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 13, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Completed the commercial product packaging comparison for Homework 4. This was done by researching Walmart and Target for party lighting systems. Many of the commerical products out today have the same foundation as the Every1 DJ, but none utilize a web application for song voting.</p>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 06</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 16, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Began working on the pinout for the microcontroller. This has not proven very challenging yet because a lot of documentation is available for the PIC microcontroller. The difficulty is making sure all parts are connected correctly and all parts are accounted for. </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 19, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>Began working the PIC18 J-Series development board. Got it connected to the PC, and loaded code onto the chip. Got the LED's to turn on and off!
