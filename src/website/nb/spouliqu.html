    <p class="entry"><b>January 15, 2014 (2 hour)</b>:<br>Met as a team during lab to discuss preliminary project proposal.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 15, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>Met as a team to begin writing preliminary project proposal. I did a lot of research on existing patents and designs. </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 18, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>Edited and completed layout for team website. </p>

    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 01 SUMMARY</b><br>
                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Submitted preliminary project proposal and got website up and running.<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 8.5 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 8.5 hours</p>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 02</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 25, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Finished cleaning up the final proposal and design schedule. All homeworks have been completed through a Google Doc form to ensure all revisions can be captured.</p>

    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 02 SUMMARY</b><br>
                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Submitted final project proposal<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 1 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 9.5 hours</p>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 03</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>Completed Eagle tutorials and schematic design homework. This will be crucial to know and understand once the PCB board is being prototyped.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 29, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>Met as a team to begin prototying the Every1 DJ. Spent a few hours deciding what will be implemented and the main design aspects. It was decided that a Raspberry Pi will be used to interface with the web application. </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 1, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Updated Team 2 website with the PSSC's and links to the completed homeworks.</p>

    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 03 SUMMARY</b><br>
                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Keeping website updated and finalizing project contraints so that parts can get ordered in a timely fashion<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 5.5 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 15 hours</p>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 04</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 2, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Created the Google Doc for Homework 3. Did priliminary research for LED's, LCD's and microcontrollers.</p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 4, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>Finialized the design contraints for the microcontoller. Decided that around 100 I/O pins will be used for the LED's, and a shift register will not be needed to expand the I/O pins. SPI interfacing and ADC is also important to interface with the Raspberry Pi. The Every1 DJ will utilize a <a id="document_link" href="http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/70616g.pdf"> DSPIC33EP512MU814-I/PH-ND </a> microntroller. 

    <br><br>Realized that heat dissipation may become an issue if all components are housed within the same unit. The system may have to utilize a fan to keep all parts cool </br></br>

    <br> Completed parts of Homework 3, including the introduction, some design contraints, interface requirements, packaging contraints, microcontroller selection and block diagram. </br>

    <br><br>Below is the block diagram for our design: </br></br>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 5, 2014(1.5 hour)</b>:<br>Researched implementations of this design to see what has been used in the past. This includes packing selection, motor use, etc. The key is to determine how the disco ball and lights will be housed (i.e. a plexiglass sphere with LED's inside, a mirrored discoball with LED's on the outside, etc). Once this is finialized, parts can be ordered. </p>

    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 04 SUMMARY</b><br>
                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Most parts selected and a final design selected.<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 5.5 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 20.5 hours</p>
