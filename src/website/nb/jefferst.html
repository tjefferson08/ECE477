    <h3 id="week01">Week 01</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 14, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br>Initialized github repo with stubs for directories and blank
      notebook templates.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 15, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br>Began a Django web application tutorial, put it under version
      control 
      (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/">step 1</a>) 
    </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 15, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:
      <br>Met as a team after class to finish writing preliminary
      project proposal.
    </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 16, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br>Continued working through Django tutorial 
      (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 2</a>)
    </p>
    
    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 01 SUMMARY</b><br>
      <u>Accomplishments</u>: Submitted preliminary project proposal.<br>
      <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 5 hours<br>
      <u>Project Work Total</u>: 5 hours<br>
    </p>
                       
    <p class="entry"><b>January 19, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Got on team account, put all team webpage materials under 
      version control.
      The repo was then reorganized and a bash script was authored to aid in staging/testing website changes in the 
      repo, then exporting them to the live hosting environment. More work will probably be involved when the same
      task is undertaken for the webapp's resources. A thought: it might be the case that the limited hosting 
      feature
      set provided by ECN will not be sufficient for the functionality required from the Every1 DJ webapp
    </p>                    
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:
      <br> Finished Django tutorial
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 2</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 2 focused on the Django-generated admin pages for each specific application
      runing on a site. So far, it will likely be sufficient to run a single app to power the project's needs.
      At the end, the step 2 tutorial previewed the template with which the user can modify the way in which the 
      python-powered content is displayed in HTML/CSS. This feature is the focus of step 3.
    </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:
      <br> Completed Django tutorial 
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial03/">step 3</a>
       and committed to repo. Switched mid-tutorial to the latest Django tutorial version (1.6); that's also what
      is installed on the development machines. Began some simple view authoring and intro to the Django template
      language. Brainstorming was briefly undertaken as to a potential data model for the song selection/sorting
      as well as storage. Atomic data element will probably be a song, with multiple attributes and views.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br> Finished Django tutorial
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial04/">step 4</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 4 included a form to calculate voting on polls, as well 
      as a switch from distinct and hardcoded to generic, flexible templates.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 26, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>
      Worked with Courney to finish the final proposal and do a rough schedule estimate. As the project progresses,
      it will be important to ensure that derivation from the previous year's DJ project remains at a minimum.
    </p>

    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 02 SUMMARY</b><br>
      <u>Accomplishments</u>: Submitted final project proposal.<br>
      <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 6 hours<br>
      <u>Project Work Total</u>: 11 hours<br>
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 26, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:</br>
      Finished up 
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 5</a> and 
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 6</a>.
      The "prototype" looks like this upon completion of step 6: <br>

      It's ugly, but it's powered by Django, and that's a start. It has become fairly evident that hard-coding
      in a Grooveshark (or similar) API call and integrating with the Django database handling will be a big
      milestone for this project. The voting/selection algorithm should be rather simple.
    </p>
   
    <p class="entry"><b>January 27, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:</br>
      Began homework 2 (PCB exercise). Investigation into API candidates for music search and selection was
      begun. One candidate looks great: <a href="http://www.tinysong.com/api">Tinysong</a>.
      It's an appealing choice because it's simple (only 3 methods) and supports the functionality
      required for the device. A separate API would be necessary to get things like album art or other image
      materials (Tinysong appears to be text info only, hence the name).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      The first testing of the tinysong API was initiated. The code was inserted into the Django tutorial app
      and tested from the Django shell. The results look like this:<br>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 29, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Attended lab with teammates. Refactoring of PSSC criteria was accomplished, and the PSSC's were
      informallly accepted. A Raspberry Pi was ordered and should arrive by Friday. Homework 2 (PCB tutorial)
      was completed, although singoff by the TA was not.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 31, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>
      Raspberry pi and accessories were delivered. Some time was spend assembling Rpi and collecting documentation. 
      The team will need an SD reader/writer in order to boot an OS on the Rpi.
    </p>

    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 03 SUMMARY</b>
      <u>Accomplishments</u>: Homework 2 - PCB tutorial<br>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 6, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Team meeting was held to complete homework 3. Part selection was accomplished (preliminary status),
      and the majority of the assignment was completed.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 7, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>
      Completed homework 3 and submitted to 477 portal.
