    	The repo was then reorganized and a bash script was authored to aid in staging/testing website changes in the 
    	repo, then exporting them to the live hosting environment. More work will probably be involved when the same
    	task is undertaken for the webapp's resources. A thought: it might be the case that the limited hosting feature
    	set provided by ECN will not be sufficient for the functionality required from the Every1 DJ webapp
