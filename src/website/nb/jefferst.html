      The repo was then reorganized and a bash script was authored to aid in staging/testing website changes in the 
      repo, then exporting them to the live hosting environment. More work will probably be involved when the same
      task is undertaken for the webapp's resources. A thought: it might be the case that the limited hosting 
      feature
      set provided by ECN will not be sufficient for the functionality required from the Every1 DJ webapp

      running on a site. So far, it will likely be sufficient to run a single app to power the project's needs.
      At the end, the step 2 tutorial previewed the template with which the user can modify the way in which the 
      python-powered content is displayed in HTML/CSS. This feature is the focus of step 3.

      is installed on the development machines. Began some simple view authoring and intro to the Django template
      language. Brainstorming was briefly undertaken as to a potential data model for the song selection/sorting
      as well as storage. Atomic data element will probably be a song, with multiple attributes and views.

      It's ugly, but it's powered by Django, and that's a start. It has become fairly evident that hard-coding
      in a Grooveshark (or similar) API call and integrating with the Django database handling will be a big
      milestone for this project. The voting/selection algorithm should be rather simple.
    </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 27, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:</br>
      Began homework 2 (PCB exercise). Investigation into API candidates for music search and selection was
      begun. One candidate looks great: <a href="http://www.tinysong.com/api">Tinysong</a>.
      It's an appealing choice because it's simple (only 3 methods) and supports the functionality
      required for the device. A separate API would be necessary to get things like album art or other image
      materials (Tinysong appears to be text info only, hence the name).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      The first testing of the tinysong API was initiated. The code was inserted into the Django tutorial app
      and tested from the Django shell. The results look like this:<br>

      Team meeting was held in lab for mandatory lab #5. Component selection feedback was received, and some 
      progress was made in part selection, especially in the previously lacking power supply and regulation
      components. It was determined that the power supply voltage should be higher than that which is required
      of the RaspberryPi (5V), so a 6.5V power supply was selected. In addition, it was decided that voltage 
      regulators would be included for both the Raspberry Pi and digital circuitry supplies. Another discussion
      centered around options for LED driving devices. A FET device and a constant current driver were the
      two discussed options, and a working FET-controlled LED design was supplied by George.
      Last, the workload for HW 4 was divided, with the majority falling to Courtney, our resident packaging
      and mechanical design specialist.

    <p class="entry"><b>February 15, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Revision of homework 4 was completed prior to its submission by Courtney. After completion of the
      revision, some initial integration effort was begun. Tool acquisition and some cabling were begun with the
      intent to start programming the microcontroller with its MPLAB IDE and evaluation kit. The first microcontroller
      task will focus on the 3-wire serial peripheral in order to communicate with the serial port on the Raspberry
      Pi. A quick setback came in the form of a missing power supply for the evaluation kit. Joe promptly supplied one,
      further integration efforts will continue in the near future.

      A Django refresher from tutorials linked above was undertaken. A small modification of the existing webapp
      was made: there is now a basic Search button on the main page:
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-18-search-button-01.png">

      </a> 
      <br>
      which performs a hard-coded call to tinysong API. This is a
      step closer to actually displaying search results in a meaningful manner. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 19, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Laboratory attendance, as usual, was mandatory, and the focus was on schematic progress and/or issues. The
      discussion was led primarily by Courtney, who then assembled a list of outstanding concerns for later 
      resolution with course staff. The hardware narrative components were largely decided, and some division
      of labor was devised. Clarification on some peripheral responsibilities for the design was an additional 
      conversation topic. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 21, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>
      A team meeting was held to aid Sophie in completion of the hardware narrative report. An individual contribution 
      of the block diagram and design decisions was made. Microcontroller port assignments were the largest set of
      decisions to be made. Some physical/connection topics were discussed with respect to schematic completion. It 
      was tentatively decided that all necessary Raspberry Pi pins, control panel (pushbutton) pins, LCD pins, and motor
      pins would probably go to connectors on the PCB, since all aforementioned components will reside at specific
      location in the package (external to PCB, internal to packaging).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 22, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      A more thorough setup by Matt of the Raspberry Pi workstation was facilitated. Access to the github repository
      was one initial accomplishment, as well as the acquiring of pre-built SPI python wrappers from 
      <a href="http://www.100randomtasks.com/simple-spi-on-raspberry-pi">100randomtasks.com</a>. <br>
      A preliminary visual inspection of the waveforms from the Raspberry Pi was promising, although a more scientific
      inspection will take place once it is more apparent how to operate some features on the MSO-X 4024A mixed-signal
      oscilloscope. <br>
      One unfortunate discovery came in the knowledge that the Raspberry Pi SPI hardware does not support slave mode.
      See page 8 of the Raspberry PI CPU 
      <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf">datasheet</a>.
      This factor will play a part in refactoring the communication design and could potentially require a slight
      schematic modification. It is natural at this stage to develop SPI (slave) TX code on the PIC eval kit in order
      to communicate with (probably) functional SPI TX/RX code on the Raspberry Pi.<br><br>
      SPI investigation on the micro side was begun, and the initial plan of attaching SPI1 as
      master to SPI2 as a slave was undertaken.
      Unfortunately, somewhere in the inclusion of the SPI.h lib file and building, an error occurred in the build
      settings. At the moment, building and programming the micro is not functional. Instead, a good goal might be 
      one of the following: strive for some meaningful progress on the Django webapp or seek to modify the clock
      rate of Raspberry Pi SPI transmission. The next entry will likely detail efforts in one of those two categories.
    </p>

      Matt successfully navigated the maze of drivers and compilers to get the MPLab IDE up and running again. 
      A small plastic header was sacrificed and leads were soldered on to allow for scoping and interconnection
      of Raspberry Pi SPI signals. The ambitious experiment 
      of micro -> Raspberry Pi transmission was set up, which looked something like this:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-comm-ckt.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-comm-ckt.jpg" alt="serial comm" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      Before scoping anything, some software debugging was necessary. The MPLab spi library partially worked, but the 
      ReadSPI() function was looping infinitely. Replacing this function call with a regular IFG (interrupt flag) poll
      solved this looping issue. Although library documentation was unsurprisingly nonexistent, it is
      assumed that the library must have been for a slightly different device family.
      Logic analyzer probes were placed on SCLK, SIMO, and MOSI, but the only observable results were noisy, meaningless signals.
      Scoping each device's output separately determined that the Raspberry Pi clock and SPI lines were the culprits.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 25, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>
      Since the Raspberry Pi SPI was not operating correctly, a quick search was performed for alternatives for SPI
      driving code. The python example was abandoned, and a C programming example was discovered (linked within) from the following
      blog <a href="http://www.brianhensley.net/2012/07/getting-spi-working-on-raspberry-pi.html">tutorial</a>.<br>
      At this point, Raspberry Pi SPI was scoped alone; SUCCESS! See the code and initial results here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-rpi.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-rpi.jpg" alt="rpi" height="200px" width="200px">

	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-serial-code.jpg" alt="code" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      Some additional code was authored to display (on the microcontroller) multi-byte transmissions from the Raspberry Pi.
      In addition, clock frequencies were matched to facilitate what will eventually be bidirectional communication.
      See evidence of frequency (62.5KHz) matching here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-adjusted-freq.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-adjusted-freq.jpg" alt="code" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      This experiment was successful! (Multiple transmissions, one way: Raspberry Pi -> micro)
      It was briefly noted that since Raspberry Pi SPI peripherals are all master-mode hardware, a switching
      protocol must be developed in software on the micro side so that it may
      operate in Master or Slave mode as appropriate to each SPI peripheral (Raspberry Pi, LCD).

      Mandatory Lab was held. Discussion centered around streaming API selection and different options. Tinysong
      (the current metadata API) returns a link to Grooveshark flash music player, but that will not suffice for 
      Raspberry Pi streaming due to system incompatibilities. Grooveshark's streaming API would be the best option, but
      it is unclear whether API key access will be granted. Should the Grooveshark API prove inaccessible, 
      two main alternatives methods were selected, in order of team preference:<br>
      - Anonymizing Grooveshark API calls with TOR to allow for previously issued keys to be reused<br>
      - Downloading youtube videos, ripping out audio on the fly, and playing from disk

      Today's session resulted in the completion of the initial PCB layout and the submission of homework 6 (PCB Layout).
      From the existing layout, many changes were made. Among the highlights are:<br>
      - Switching from BJT motor control circuitry to the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf">L239D Motor Driver</a> IC<br>
      - Reassigning several incorrect pin assignments from the microcontroller to the LED driver<br>
      - Changing to a 6-pin RJ-11 connector and routing programming pins correctly<br>
      - Routing power and ground to microcontroller bypass capacitors<br>
      - Creating all power and ground planes<br>
      The report for homework #6 was completed in parallel to the PCB layout activities.

      Further development of SPI communication between the Raspberry Pi and the microcontroller was undertaken. 
      After modifying the spi code module on the Raspberry pi to adjust clock frequency, successful receipt on 
      the micro side was observed. However, it was not immediately transparent when each device would
      be receiving or transmitting, due to the granularity of control on the Raspberry Pi being limited
      to a single function call which performs both reading and writing on the SPI bus. Adding a few 
      more SPI interactions on the microcontroller side with different TX data yielded more obvious 
      insight as to the timing between the two components. <br/><br/>
      A brief session of practice and presentation outlining was held.<br/><br/>

      Some schematic rework was performed to prepare fully for the design review.<br/>
      - A 0 Ohm resistor was added between the analog and digital grounds to 
      allow for separate testing on the PCB<br/>
      - A series resistor was added for each LED header pin to limit current<br/>
      - An RJ-11 connector was added for programming using the MPlab reference for pin connections<br/>
      - A new power supply was selected due to incorrect current calculations<br/>

      A modification to the webapp was made in order to connect the text in the search box
      to the actually search terms of the API call. This was accomplished by adding POST
      data to the form with an input tag, then using Django's POST dictionary object to
      retrieve it on the button press event: <br>

      Prototyping with the LEDs was begun in order to get an idea of the current and
      voltage characteristics. The power supply was used with 3.3V supply and 
      100mA current limit, since this is the expected characteristic of the power
      delivery circuitry on the PCB. Thankfully, the LEDs were extremely bright 
      even on the relatively low current setting. See the setup and results here:<br/>

      Results display was modified to meaningfully display the search results. This
      was accomplished by adding a context variable to the Results View, which 
      passed along the Song object to be rendered by the results.html template.

      A vote button was added on the results page and connected to its own view. The button is hard-coded
      to a specific song for testing, and text dumps 'not in db' if the song ID isn't yet in the DB.
      This will be the case for adding a new DB entry, but it's not relevant until additional data
      can be passed from the vote button. Currently, all we can get is the song ID, but we need
      artist, etc.
      Some research shows two popular ways of passing extra data on a single button press. One is the use of 
      Django 'session variables'. The second, simpler way is to add 'hidden' input fields to the form. 
      This was successfully achieved once a bug was worked out. It is important to notice that when testing,
      using the same song ID with different metadata will NOT overwrite the current DB entry, which is
      actually correct functionality. See the hidden input fields here:<br/>

      A home link was added to the song details page to facilitate navigation. The app's current use case is look 
      at top 5 or 10 (moving to 10), search, vote, view results, then go back to home. To further streamline usage, voting buttons 
      (both up and down) were added to the top 10 song listings. The top 10 display was corrected to sort descending on votes.

      Basic API functionality was achieved by implementing a 'headless' view which serves only to handle

      as expected, although the interface forces the user to interact on a pixel level, which creates
      a more tedious task than initially expected.
      An 8x8 pixel character format was selected and a LCDWrite function was written which takes a string
      argument. The string is then looped over, and each char is decoded in a 26-case switch statement:<br/>

      respond with top 5 song IDs, comma delimited. These will be read by groove.py and downloaded
      in a process separate from playback control. <br/><br/>

      The entire team met to be updated on spring break progress. An agenda was created to 
      prioritize remaining work. Some discussion of SPI command/response protocol showed 
      that Raspberry Pi will need to be able to pause SPI pulses to allow the micro to control the clock
      for LCD communication. Peer evaluations were completed.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>March 23, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      Spi bidirectional communication with Raspberry Pi was re-verified and tied to the SPI ISR.
      Groove.py was modified again to allow for subprocess communication. The mpg123
      utility is now opened in -R remote mode to allow for commands like play, load,
      and many more. This will allow all the playback functionality the project will need.
      After installing django on the Raspberry Pi and running groove.py in tandem, no performance
      issues were observed, so the decision was made to pursue deploying the webapp locally
      on the Raspberry Pi rather than Google App engine.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>March 25, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      A dummy c file was written and compiled on the Raspberry Pi. The a.out file was then called
      from groove.py to prove the concept of calling the C-compiled spi handler and 
      monitoring its stdout. This works as expected, via either the subprocess.check_output call
      or the subprocess.stdout.readline() call. 
      It's been noted that the downloading thread blocks any other calls until the wget utility
      has exited. This will prove to be acceptable, because the periodic requesting of the top 5
      is not particularly important if a song is downloading. However, playback and SPI
      monitoring will be put into a separate process, because timing is much more important
      to those pieces of functionality.

      Mandatory lab session #11 was held. Two parts were determined to have been ordered in the
      wrong package, so the correct devices were ordered promptly. <br/>

      Two glaring errors in the PCB routing were discovered while working on homework 9 - software 
      narrative. The I2C pins were routed to the incorrect ports and there is a Vdd/Vss mix-up on 
      adjacent pins. Adjustment strategies will be discussed as board assembly progresses.

      Audio sampling prototyping was begun. A meaningful waveform was scoped from the middle of the circuit, but
      a connection error ruined the actual output waveform. A protoboard for the audio circuit will be 
      obtained to ensure that a wiring error is not the culprit.

      Stepper motor control and PWM research was carried out in order to complete homework #9. It is tentatively

    <p class="entry"><b>March 29, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>
      Groove.py was further modified to encapsulate requesting/downloading into its own
      process. It is launched at the beginning of main() and left alone for the duration of
      the software's operation. 
      A pipe to the output of the mpg123 playback process was constructed to both allow for
      metadata retrieval and for playback modification. It was determined that the end of a song
      will be easily detectable with a subprocess.stdout.readline() call, since the output
      of the utility in -R mode is very easy to split and decode.

      The actual downloading code portion was put into its own function in order that it
      can be called from either process. This was done to allow for the case that a song
      shoots up into the top 5 before the periodic downloader can download it. This would cause
      a delay in playback, but it would be minimal and is necessary to ensure that the 
      device functions correctly.

      I2C functionality was prototyped with the micro in master mode. After a start condition

      A very strange issue occurs when the SPI pins are connected both to the Raspberry Pi and to the LCD 
      (with the micro in between). The waveforms of the SPI outputs pulse in the right order and
      with the right timing characteristics, but the waves fail to be held high for any significant
      period. The results appears to be a correctly-timed glitch sequence. Additional input will be 
      sought from course staff.<br/>

      It was decided to pursue I2C communication as a potential fix for the SPI
      electrical issues on the Raspberry Pi. The I2C peripheral was set up and
      some meaningful data was displayed on the oscilloscope. Blaine's advice
      was taken and start and end conditions were carefully monitored to ensure
      that transfers were fully exited prior to initialization of a subsequent
      packet.

      The PCB layout (and schematic) was updated to resolve large issues: namely, the Vcc and
      Vss swap on one of the microcontroller decoupling capacitors and the
      unfortunate misplacement of the I2C peripheral pins. At this point, the
      plan is to submit a second PCB iteration while concurrently physically 
      modifying the existing board as needed.

      MAN LAB session was held. Previously prototyped I2C software was developed
      further with the specific needs of the LCD in mind. LCD data display was
      achieved, and the software was modularized to allow for flexible usage in
      its target environment (and for later use with the LED Driver).
      The audio circuit was prototyped fully - this is the critical path which
      must be remedied prior to the finalization of the revised PCB
      submission. All points of interest in the audio circuit were scoped and
      inspected for proper function. The breakdown is localized to the current
      amplifier, but a single part failure was ruled out by testing a clean
      part. This issue was left unresolved at the end of MAN LAB.

      Due to difficulties with the audio circuitry, a second entry point to the
      micro ADC channel was included in the second revision of the PCB to allow
      for last-minute addition of corrected audio circuitry via an external
      protoboard. The op-amp issue was resolved by correcting bias voltages, and
      the audio output signal was improved significantly by scoping behind the
      envelope detector. The decision to exclude the envelope detector was made,
      due to the apparent workability of the existing waveform.

      Now that I2C functionality has been wrapped nicely into SW functions, some
      design was undertaken with respect to the I2C LED driver/controller. 
      Group dimming and frequency control, turning off the auto-increment
      feature, and ignoring all pattern control and and I2C subaddresses were
      all design decisions made today. The first test will be with OE LED state
      register set to be entirely on, ignoring all dimming, frequency, etc.
      Unfortunately, the LED driver will not be testable until a protoboard can
      be obtained and populated. <br>

      Further investigation into the motor settings was made. The hope was to
      use the built in Enhanced PWM's full-bridge mode, but it was noted that
      the pins in the current design do not make up a full peripheral
      pinout. There are also some doubts as to whether the full-bridge mode is
      the correct output for full stepper motor functionality. The current
      solution is to flywire the rest of the PWM peripheral to the existing
      micro traces.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>April 8, 2014 (4.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      The current LED driver assembly was built incorrectly (wrong pad spacing), 
      so an attempt was made to reassemble it. A motor protoboard was also
      assembled at this time. After doing so, I2C communication
      with the driver was prototyped with minimal success. Meaningful data was
      observed on the scope, but output on the LED driver pins did not follow
      any meaningful pattern. The I2C communication was slowed to ensure that it
      met the driver's specified speed constraints. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>April 8, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>
      Further I2C inspection revealed that the driver failed to nack the requests from
      the microcontroller. Some small changes to the software yielded
      successful mitigation of the nacking problems. Unfortunately, the output
      remained unchanged. The I2C resistors and supply voltage were modified a
      bit to ensure that an I2C 'high' signal was indeed being delivered, but
      the successful acking of the address byte implies that this threshold
      issue is not the underlying problem here.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>April 9, 2014 (5 hours)</b>:<br>
      MAN LAB session was held. LED driver I2C was (still) debugged. The driver
      continued to ack requests from the microcontroller, but output continued
      to fail to follow any meaningful request pattern. At this point, it is
      assumed that the issue is likely a problem with the protoboard connections
      or a bridged pin. The decision was made to assemble the part on the board 
      and retest it in the near future.

      A switch in focus was made to the motor. The output of the full-bridge PWM
      module was, upon inspection, deemed to be be unfit with respect to the
      motor's specifications. Instead, a GAL device was obtained and a step
      sequence was programmed into it, with a simple clock signal originating
      from a micro pin. This worked nicely, but a further improvement was made
      by ignoring the GAL device altogether and simple toggling the sequence on
      GPIO's, initiated by a timer interrupt. This solution uses the existing
      micro traces and does not require the addition of a GAL device, which is
      ideal.

      arrays in the SPI module (they have not yet been delivered correctly by
      the Raspberry Pi python code).

      A microcontroller successfully programs on a protoboard, but fails to do

      microcontroller will be tested shortly. 
      SPI calls were successfully incorporated into groove.py, and return codes

      driver via I2C.
      More time was invested in redirecting HTTP requests inbound to the Raspberry Pi
      with limited success. SSH to the device is open, so it should be a simple
      matter of adding the server port to the list of allowed ports.

      Moving the motor circuitry to the PCB was successful, with a small
      caveat. The output-enable of the level translator was inadvertently tied
      high, so it was corrected by fly-wiring to a microcontroller GPIO. 
      Additionally, one motor pin was floating to do a soldering error, which was
      quickly corrected. At this point, the motor works as expected and speed is
      easily adjustable by changing the timer interrupt interval.
      Also, IP redirection was resolved by running the python dev server
      explicitly on the Raspberry Pi's external IP, so requests made are now
      handled appropriately. This even allows for access on mobile devices via
      Wi-Fi.

      Top-level url redirection was corrected: there is no longer a need to manually type xx.xx.xx:8000/songs/,
      a user only needs IP and port.
      Some code was added in groove.py to continue playback after a song
      'naturally' completes (no next-song button press).

      The LED driver's output was corrected with some small software updates.
      Output was further improved once it was understood that setting LEDs to
      follow GRPPWM and GRPFREQ still necessitates setting the LED's individual
      PWM reg (it follows both).

      After some success with the LED driver, the ADC sampling was
      investigates. The output of the Raspberry Pi was sent through the audio
      circuitry and tied to an ADC input channel of the microcontroller. A beat
      threshold was set in software to allow for easy modification to achieve
      aesthetically pleasing results. This will incur a small delay, but this
      seems rather unavoidable at this juncture, as buffering or pre-sampling
      both seem rather difficult.

    <p class="entry"><b>April 27, 2014 (5 hours)</b> SPI interactions between
      The microcontroller and Raspberry Pi were modified to seek and relay input
      from the webapp. The Raspberry Pi communicates  and undertakes the
      next-song action, which prepares the micro for metadata consumption. The
      Raspberry Pi then sends 4 20-char strings with meaningful metadata, which
      the microcontroller stores for subsequent transmission to the LCD via I2C.

      Attempting to start pulling sub-components together an run them
      simultaneously were undertaken. Specifically, incorporating LED driver
      updates and ADC sampling with the SPI/webapp/LCD portion was the main
      integration effort. Unfortunately, a malfunction between the micro and
      Raspberry Pi resulted in an inoperable Raspberry Pi. A replacement was
      promptly ordered. <br>

      The motor circuitry was re-worked; some de-soldering had loosened a
      connection on a level-translator pin. Pushbuttons were momentarily
      inoperable, but the electrical issue was resolved once all had been
      packages (floating pins). A buffer chip: 74HC244N was included to isolate
      the microcontroller and Raspberry Pi. Packaging and integration efforts
      continued with mixed success. All the PSSCs were demonstrable, but the
      simultaneous powering of more than 3-4 individual LEDs created
      inexplicable noise on the SPI line, which broke the rest of the
      functionality.

    <p class="entry"><b>May 1, 2014 (3.5 hours)</b>
      The root cause of the integration issue was discovered: the current draw
      on the 5V supply created some instability in the buffer chip, which had
      been incorrectly biased with 5V (rather than the SPI logic level
      3.3V). Once 3.3V was brought to the buffer chip, the device operated
      correctly.

      The IP configuration was modified heavily to allow for maximum interaction
      at the Design showcase. A bridge to a laptop LAN port was made for
      hosting; unfortunately, this does not allow users to access the webapp via
      Wi-Fi. This was an unfortunate restriction of the MSEE Atrium demo space
      (no network drops were available). <br>

      The device was later demo'ed at the Design Showcase.
