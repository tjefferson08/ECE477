      The repo was then reorganized and a bash script was authored to aid in staging/testing website changes in the 
      repo, then exporting them to the live hosting environment. More work will probably be involved when the same
      task is undertaken for the webapp's resources. A thought: it might be the case that the limited hosting 
      feature
      set provided by ECN will not be sufficient for the functionality required from the Every1 DJ webapp

      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 2</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 2 focused on the Django-generated admin pages for each specific application
      runing on a site. So far, it will likely be sufficient to run a single app to power the project's needs.
      At the end, the step 2 tutorial previewed the template with which the user can modify the way in which the 
      python-powered content is displayed in HTML/CSS. This feature is the focus of step 3.

       and committed to repo. Switched mid-tutorial to the latest Django tutorial version (1.6); that's also what
      is installed on the development machines. Began some simple view authoring and intro to the Django template
      language. Brainstorming was briefly undertaken as to a potential data model for the song selection/sorting
      as well as storage. Atomic data element will probably be a song, with multiple attributes and views.

      It's ugly, but it's powered by Django, and that's a start. It has become fairly evident that hard-coding
      in a Grooveshark (or similar) API call and integrating with the Django database handling will be a big
      milestone for this project. The voting/selection algorithm should be rather simple.
    </p>
   
    <p class="entry"><b>January 27, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:</br>
      Began homework 2 (PCB exercise). Investigation into API candidates for music search and selection was
      begun. One candidate looks great: <a href="http://www.tinysong.com/api">Tinysong</a>.
      It's an appealing choice because it's simple (only 3 methods) and supports the functionality
      required for the device. A separate API would be necessary to get things like album art or other image
      materials (Tinysong appears to be text info only, hence the name).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      The first testing of the tinysong API was initiated. The code was inserted into the Django tutorial app
      and tested from the Django shell. The results look like this:<br>

      Attended lab with teammates. Refactoring of PSSC criteria was accomplished, and the PSSC's were
      informallly accepted. A Raspberry Pi was ordered and should arrive by Friday. Homework 2 (PCB tutorial)
      was completed, although singoff by the TA was not.

      Team meeting was held in lab for mandatory lab #5. Component selection feedback was received, and some 
      progress was made in part selection, especially in the previously lacking power supply and regulation
      components. It was determined that the power supply voltage should be higher than that which is required
      of the RaspberryPi (5V), so a 6.5V power supply was selected. In addition, it was decided that voltage 
      regulators would be included for both the Raspberry Pi and digital circuitry supplies. Another discussion
      centered around options for LED driving devices. A FET device and a constant current driver were the
      two discussed options, and a working FET-controlled LED design was supplied by George.
      Last, the workload for HW 4 was divided, with tha majority falling to Courtney, our resident packaging
      and mechanical design specialist. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 15, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Revision of homework 4 was completed prior to its submission by Courtney. After completion of the
      revision, some initial integration effort was begun. Tool acquisition and some cabling were begun with the
      intent to start programming the microcontroller with its MPLAB IDE and evaluation kit. The first microcontroller
      task will focus on the 3-wire serial peripheral in order to communicate with the serial port on the Raspberry
      Pi. A quick setback came in the form of a missing power supply for the evaluation kit. Joe promptly supplied one,
      further integration efforts will continue in the near future.

      A Django refresher from tutorials linked above was undertaken. A small modification of the existing webapp
      was made: there is now a basic Search button on the main page:
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-18-search-button-01.png">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-18-search-button-01.png" alt="screenshot1" height="200px" width="200px">

      </a> 
      <br>
      which performs a hard-coded call to tinysong API. This is a
      step closer to actually displaying search results in a meaningful manner. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 19, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Labratory attendance, as usual, was mandatory, and the focus was on schematic progress and/or issues. The
      discussion was led primarily by Courtney, who then assembled a list of outstanding concerns for later 
      resolution with course staff. The hardware narrative components were largely decided, and some division
      of labor was devised. Clarification on some peripheral responsibilities for the design was an additional 
      conversation topic. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 21, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>
      A team meeting was held to aid Sophie in completion of the hardware narrative report. An individual contribution 
      of the block diagram and design decisions was made. Microcontroller port assignments were the largest set of
      decisions to be made. Some physical/connection topics were discussed with respect to schematic completion. It 
      was tentativel decided that all necessary Raspberry Pi pins, control panel (pushbutton) pins, LCD pins, and motor
      pins would probably go to connectors on the PCB, since all aforementioned components will reside at specific
      location in the package (external to PCB, internal to packaging).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 22, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      A more thorough setup by Matt of the Raspberry Pi workstation was facilitated. Access to the github repository
      was one initial accomplishment, as well as the acquiring of pre-built SPI python wrappers from 
      <a href="http://www.100randomtasks.com/simple-spi-on-raspberry-pi">100randomtasks.com</a>. <br>
      A preliminary visual inspection of the waveforms from the Raspberry Pi was promising, although a more scientific
      inspection will take place once it is more apparent how to operate some features on the MSO-X 4024A mixed-signal
      oscilloscope. <br>
      One unfortunate discovery came in the knowledge that the Raspberry Pi SPI harware does not support slave mode.
      See page 8 of the Raspberry PI CPU 
      <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf">datasheet</a>.
      This factor will play a part in refactoring the communication design and could potentially require a slight
      schematic modification. It is natural at this stage to develop SPI (slave) TX code on the PIC eval kit in order
      to communicate with (probably) functional SPI TX/RX code on the Raspberry Pi.<br><br>
      SPI investigation on the micro side was begun, and the initial plan of attaching SPI1 as
      master to SPI2 as a slave was undertaken.
      Unfortunately, somewhere in the inclusion of the SPI.h lib file and building, an error occurred in the build
      settings. At the moment, building and programming the micro is not functional. Instead, a good goal might be 
      one of the following: strive for some meaningul progress on the Django webapp or seek to modify the clock
      rate of Rpi SPI transmission. The next entry will likely detail efforts in one of those two categories.
    </p>

      Matt successfully navigated the maze of drivers and compilers to get the MPLab IDE up and running again. 
      A small plastic header was sacrificed and leads were soldered on to allow for scoping and interconnection
      of Raspberry Pi SPI signals. The ambitious experiment 
      of micro -> Rpi transmission was set up, whcih looked something like this:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-comm-ckt.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-comm-ckt.jpg" alt="serial comm" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      Before scoping anything, some software debugging was necessary. The MPLab spi library partially worked, but the 
      ReadSPI() function was loopinf infinitely. Replacing this function call with a regular IFG (interrupt flag) poll
      solved this looping issue. Although library dodumentation was unsurprisingly nonexistent, it is
      assumed that the library must have been for a slightly different device family.
      Logic analyzer probes were placed on SCLK, SIMO, and MOSI, but the only observable results were noisy, meaningless signals.
      Scoping each device's output separately determined that the Raspberry Pi clock and SPI lines were the culprits.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 25, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>
      Since the Rpi SPI was not operating correctly, a quick search was performed for alternatives for SPI
      driving code. The python example was abandoned, and a C programming example was discovered (linked within) from the following
      blog <a href="http://www.brianhensley.net/2012/07/getting-spi-working-on-raspberry-pi.html">tutorial</a>.<br>
      At this point, Rpi SPI was scoped alone; SUCCESS! See the code and initial results here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-rpi.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-rpi.jpg" alt="rpi" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> 
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-serial-code.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-serial-code.jpg" alt="code" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      Some additional code was authored to display (on the microcontroller) multi-byte transmissions from the Rpi.
      In addition, clock frequencies were matched to facilitate what will eventually be bidirectional communication.
      See evidence of frequency (62.5KHz) matching here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-adjusted-freq.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-adjusted-freq.jpg" alt="code" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      This experiment was successful! (Multiple transmissions, one way: Rpi -> micro)
      It was briefly noted that since Rpi SPI peripherals are all master-mode hardware, a switching
      protocol must be developed in software on the micro side so that it may
      operate in Master or Slave mode as appropriate to each SPI peripheral (Rpi, LCD).

      Mandatory Lab was held. Descussion centered around streaming API selection and different options. Tinysong
      (the current metadata API) returns a link to Grooveshark flash music player, but that will not suffice for 
      Rpi streaming due to system incompatibilites. Grooveshark's streaming API would be the best option, but
      it is unclear whether API key access will be granted. Should the Grooveshark API prove inaccessible, 
      two main alternatives methods were selected, in order of team preference:<br>
      - Anonymizing Grooveshark API calls with TOR to allow for previously issued keys to be reused<br>
      - Downloading youtube videos, ripping out audio on the fly, and playing from disk

      Today's session resulted in the completion of the initial PCB layout and the submission of homework 6 (PCB Layout).
      From the existing layout, many changes were made. Among the highlights are:<br>
      - Switching from BJT motor control circuitry to the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf">L239D Motor Driver</a> IC<br>
      - Reassigning several incorrect pin assignments from the microcontroller to the LED driver<br>
      - Changing to a 6-pin RJ-11 connector and routing programming pins correctly<br>
      - Routing power and ground to microcontoller bypass capacitors<br>
      - Creating all power and ground planes<br>
      The report for homework #6 was completed in parallel to the PCB layout activities.

      Further development of SPI communication between the Rapsberry Pi and the microcontroller was undertaken. 
      After modifying the spi code module on the Rasperry pi to adjust clock frequency, successful receipt on 
      the micro side was observed. However, it was not immediately transparent when each device would
      be receiving or transmitting, due to the granularity of control on the Raspberry Pi being limited
      to a single function call which performs both reading and writing on the SPI bus. Adding a few 
      more SPI interactions on the microcrontroller side with different TX data yielded more obvious 
      insight as to the timing between the two components. <br/><br/>
      A brief session of practice and presentation outlining was held.<br/><br/>

      Some schematic rework was performed to prepare fully for the design review.<br/>
      - A 0 Ohm resistor was added between the analog and digital grounds to 
        allow for separate testing on the PCB<br/>
      - A series resistor was added for each LED header pin to limit current<br/>
      - An RJ-11 connector was added for programming using the MPlab reference for pin connections<br/>
      - A new power supply was selected due to incorrect current calculations<br/>

      A modification to the webapp was made in order to connect the text in the search box
      to the actualy search terms of the API call. This was accomplished by adding POST
      data to the form with an input tag, then using Django's POST dictionary object to
      retrieve it on the button press event: <br>

      Prototyping with the LEDs was begun in order to get an idea of the current and
      voltage characteristics. The power supply was used with 3.3V supply and 
      100mA current limit, since this is the espected characteristic of the power
      delivery circuitry on the PCB. Thankfully, the LEDs were extremely bright 
      even on the relatively low current setting. See the setup and results here:<br/>

      Results display wasy modified to meaningully display the search results. This
      was accomplished by adding a context variable to the Results View, which 
      passed along the Song object to be rendered by the results.html template.
      See the formatted results display here: <br/>

      A vote button was added on the results page and connected to its own view. The button is hard-coded
      to a specific song for testing, and text dumps 'not in db' if the song ID isn't yet in the DB.
      This will be the case for adding a new DB entry, but it's not relevant until additional data
      can be passed from the vote button. Currently, all we can get is the song ID, but we need
      artist, etc.
      Some research shows two popular ways of passing extra data on a single button press. One is the use of 
      Django 'session variables'. The second, simpler way is to add 'hidden' input fields to the form. 
      This was successfully acheived once a bug was worked out. It is important to notice that when testing,
      using the same song ID with different metadata will NOT overwrite the current DB entry, which is
      actually correct functionality. See the hidden input fields here:<br/>

      The webapp homepage was modified to display top 3 results in the database, sorted descending on title field.<br/>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-03-09-home-display-songspng">

      </a> <br/><br/>
      A home link was added to the song details page to facilitate navigation. The app's current use case is look 
      at top 5 or 10 (moving to 10), search, vote, view results, then go back to home. To further streamline usage, voting buttons 
      (both up and down) were added to the top 10 song listings. The top 10 display was corrected to sort descending on votes.
      See the formatted result here:<br/>

      </a> <br/><br/>
      Voting down functionality was connected to -1 button with another hidden POST element. Voting was
      ensured to never push votes below 0. <br/><br/>
      Basic API functionality was acheived by implementing a 'headless' view which serves only to handle
      requests, not render any page. The response is currently the song title in ISO string form, 
      but it will likely move to the song ID code in string form. <br/><br/>
      Research for webapp deployment on the Rpi was carried out, the following candidates were discovered
      <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=7208&p=403771">here</a> and
      <a href="http://blog.mattwoodward.com/2013/01/setting-up-django-on-raspberry-pi.html">here</a>

      LCD development was undertaken. A checkerboard function was tested from an online source. It performed
      as expected, although the interface forces the user to interact on a pixel level, which creates
      a more tedious task than initially expected.
      An 8x8 pixel characted format was selected and a LCDWrite function was written which takes a string
      argument. The string is then looped over, and each char is decoded in a 26-case switch statement:<br/>
      
      
      - we did A and printed it AAAAAAAH - picture
      - problem was not enough current and never resetting page and column positions after ram clear/checkerboard
      - bug in initial vote now

      - need to do some startup webapp stuff to check for the correct libraries like pthon requests
      - could potentially deploy using google's app engine, but we might need to work aroung the python requests lib (won't be installed)
      - the IDs from groove.py and tinysong appear to line up, so I can probably skip the user portion of groove.py and just use the back end
      - modified the django 'api' to respond with the top 5 current songIds, comma delimited
      - added a small layer of security, a GET data check in order to request next song
      - added a bag of sorts to eliminate re-downloading of songs by groove.py, working well so far
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>March 19, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      - researched deployment strategies, Google app engine looks like a good one, so I created a project to play with
      - google tutorial <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql/django">here</a>
      - google's SQL instance is NOT FREE, so we have two evident other options: 
           1) work with django-nonrel to sit totally on top of google app engine, less integration, more project setup
           <a href="django-nonrel.org">nonrel</a>
           2) try to get django and nginx and IP forwarding figured out on the rpi itself (slightly more favorable)

      - modifying groove.py to be much more autonomous and headless, need to add playback functionality, maybe with mpg123 unix lib
      - tweaked requestNext api call to include 'pull' arg (GET) depending on whether we immediately need a new song or not
      - tested mpg123 for mp3 playback on rpi - works!

      spi talking bidirectional again, got ISR to fire
      linked spi and LCD calls (picture would be nice)
      
      got multiprocess playback working in a simple way
       - switched to -R interface for mpg123
       - was getting a terminal setting error message, using -R changes interaction pattern
      determined that rpi deployment of webapp will probably be sufficient after testing preformance

      wrote and called a dummy a.out to prove that I could, and I can check its output too,
      this will probabl be how we interact with the spi c file on the rpi
      wget is blocking other threads, switch to process? multiprocess???????????

      2 parts don't fit - both can be ordered in appropriate packages/footprints
      writing report #9, discovered I2C pins are not correctly routed

      - further multithreading rpi python code
      - pushing downloader loop into multiprocess appears to have rendered it ineffective
      - mpg123 does NOT exit after a song is played (once we open it with R flag, that is)
      - mpg123 in silent mode will still give me text output on return from a song, which is
        GREAT! I'll use that to skip tracks naturally
      - successfully carved out the downloader loop into its own process - python multiprocessing module
      - divided out actual downloading portion so it can be called from both processes
