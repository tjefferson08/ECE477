    <p class="entry"><b>January 19, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Got on team account, put all team webpage materials under 
      version control.
      The repo was then reorganized and a bash script was authored to aid in staging/testing website changes in the 
      repo, then exporting them to the live hosting environment. More work will probably be involved when the same
      task is undertaken for the webapp's resources. A thought: it might be the case that the limited hosting 
      feature
      set provided by ECN will not be sufficient for the functionality required from the Every1 DJ webapp
    </p>                    
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:
      <br> Finished Django tutorial
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 2</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 2 focused on the Django-generated admin pages for each specific application
      runing on a site. So far, it will likely be sufficient to run a single app to power the project's needs.
      At the end, the step 2 tutorial previewed the template with which the user can modify the way in which the 
      python-powered content is displayed in HTML/CSS. This feature is the focus of step 3.
    </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:
      <br> Completed Django tutorial 
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial03/">step 3</a>
       and committed to repo. Switched mid-tutorial to the latest Django tutorial version (1.6); that's also what
      is installed on the development machines. Began some simple view authoring and intro to the Django template
      language. Brainstorming was briefly undertaken as to a potential data model for the song selection/sorting
      as well as storage. Atomic data element will probably be a song, with multiple attributes and views.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br> Finished Django tutorial
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial04/">step 4</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 4 included a form to calculate voting on polls, as well 
      as a switch from distinct and hardcoded to generic, flexible templates.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 26, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>
      Worked with Courney to finish the final proposal and do a rough schedule estimate. As the project progresses,
      it will be important to ensure that derivation from the previous year's DJ project remains at a minimum.

      Finished up 
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 5</a> and 
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 6</a>.
      The "prototype" looks like this upon completion of step 6: <br>

      It's ugly, but it's powered by Django, and that's a start. It has become fairly evident that hard-coding
      in a Grooveshark (or similar) API call and integrating with the Django database handling will be a big
      milestone for this project. The voting/selection algorithm should be rather simple.
    </p>
   
    <p class="entry"><b>January 27, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:</br>
      Began homework 2 (PCB exercise). Investigation into API candidates for music search and selection was
      begun. One candidate looks great: <a href="http://www.tinysong.com/api">Tinysong</a>.
      It's an appealing choice because it's simple (only 3 methods) and supports the functionality
      required for the device. A separate API would be necessary to get things like album art or other image
      materials (Tinysong appears to be text info only, hence the name).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      The first testing of the tinysong API was initiated. The code was inserted into the Django tutorial app
      and tested from the Django shell. The results look like this:<br>

      Attended lab with teammates. Refactoring of PSSC criteria was accomplished, and the PSSC's were
      informallly accepted. A Raspberry Pi was ordered and should arrive by Friday. Homework 2 (PCB tutorial)
      was completed, although singoff by the TA was not.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 31, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>
      Raspberry pi and accessories were delivered. Some time was spend assembling Rpi and collecting documentation. 
      The team will need an SD reader/writer in order to boot an OS on the Rpi.

      Team meeting was held in lab for mandatory lab #5. Component selection feedback was received, and some 
      progress was made in part selection, especially in the previously lacking power supply and regulation
      components. It was determined that the power supply voltage should be higher than that which is required
      of the RaspberryPi (5V), so a 6.5V power supply was selected. In addition, it was decided that voltage 
      regulators would be included for both the Raspberry Pi and digital circuitry supplies. Another discussion
      centered around options for LED driving devices. A FET device and a constant current driver were the
      two discussed options, and a working FET-controlled LED design was supplied by George.
      Last, the workload for HW 4 was divided, with tha majority falling to Courtney, our resident packaging
      and mechanical design specialist. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 15, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Revision of homework 4 was completed prior to its submission by Courtney. After completion of the
      revision, some initial integration effort was begun. Tool acquisition and some cabling were begun with the
      intent to start programming the microcontroller with its MPLAB IDE and evaluation kit. The first microcontroller
      task will focus on the 3-wire serial peripheral in order to communicate with the serial port on the Raspberry
      Pi. A quick setback came in the form of a missing power supply for the evaluation kit. Joe promptly supplied one,
      further integration efforts will continue in the near future.

      A Django refresher from tutorials linked above was undertaken. A small modification of the existing webapp
      was made: there is now a basic Search button on the main page:
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-18-search-button-01.png">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-18-search-button-01.png" alt="screenshot1" height="200px" width="200px">

      </a> 
      <br>
      which performs a hard-coded call to tinysong API. This is a
      step closer to actually displaying search results in a meaningful manner. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 19, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Labratory attendance, as usual, was mandatory, and the focus was on schematic progress and/or issues. The
      discussion was led primarily by Courtney, who then assembled a list of outstanding concerns for later 
      resolution with course staff. The hardware narrative components were largely decided, and some division
      of labor was devised. Clarification on some peripheral responsibilities for the design was an additional 
      conversation topic. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 21, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>
      A team meeting was held to aid Sophie in completion of the hardware narrative report. An individual contribution 
      of the block diagram and design decisions was made. Microcontroller port assignments were the largest set of
      decisions to be made. Some physical/connection topics were discussed with respect to schematic completion. It 
      was tentativel decided that all necessary Raspberry Pi pins, control panel (pushbutton) pins, LCD pins, and motor
      pins would probably go to connectors on the PCB, since all aforementioned components will reside at specific
      location in the package (external to PCB, internal to packaging).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 22, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      A more thorough setup by Matt of the Raspberry Pi workstation was facilitated. Access to the github repository
      was one initial accomplishment, as well as the acquiring of pre-built SPI python wrappers from 
      <a href="http://www.100randomtasks.com/simple-spi-on-raspberry-pi">100randomtasks.com</a>. <br>
      A preliminary visual inspection of the waveforms from the Raspberry Pi was promising, although a more scientific
      inspection will take place once it is more apparent how to operate some features on the MSO-X 4024A mixed-signal
      oscilloscope. <br>
      One unfortunate discovery came in the knowledge that the Raspberry Pi SPI harware does not support slave mode.
      See page 8 of the Raspberry PI CPU 
      <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf">datasheet</a>.
      This factor will play a part in refactoring the communication design and could potentially require a slight
      schematic modification. It is natural at this stage to develop SPI (slave) TX code on the PIC eval kit in order
      to communicate with (probably) functional SPI TX/RX code on the Raspberry Pi.<br><br>
      SPI investigation on the micro side was begun, and the initial plan of attaching SPI1 as
      master to SPI2 as a slave was undertaken.
      Unfortunately, somewhere in the inclusion of the SPI.h lib file and building, an error occurred in the build
      settings. At the moment, building and programming the micro is not functional. Instead, a good goal might be 
      one of the following: strive for some meaningul progress on the Django webapp or seek to modify the clock
      rate of Rpi SPI transmission. The next entry will likely detail efforts in one of those two categories.
