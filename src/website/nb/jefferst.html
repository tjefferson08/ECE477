      The repo was then reorganized and a bash script was authored to aid in staging/testing website changes in the 
      repo, then exporting them to the live hosting environment. More work will probably be involved when the same
      task is undertaken for the webapp's resources. A thought: it might be the case that the limited hosting 
      feature
      set provided by ECN will not be sufficient for the functionality required from the Every1 DJ webapp

    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:
      <br> Finished Django tutorial
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 2</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 2 focused on the Django-generated admin pages for each specific application
      runing on a site. So far, it will likely be sufficient to run a single app to power the project's needs.
      At the end, the step 2 tutorial previewed the template with which the user can modify the way in which the 
      python-powered content is displayed in HTML/CSS. This feature is the focus of step 3.

       and committed to repo. Switched mid-tutorial to the latest Django tutorial version (1.6); that's also what
      is installed on the development machines. Began some simple view authoring and intro to the Django template
      language. Brainstorming was briefly undertaken as to a potential data model for the song selection/sorting
      as well as storage. Atomic data element will probably be a song, with multiple attributes and views.

      as a switch from distinct and hardcoded to generic, flexible templates.

      Worked with Courney to finish the final proposal and do a rough schedule estimate. As the project progresses,
      it will be important to ensure that derivation from the previous year's DJ project remains at a minimum.

      It's ugly, but it's powered by Django, and that's a start. It has become fairly evident that hard-coding
      in a Grooveshark (or similar) API call and integrating with the Django database handling will be a big
      milestone for this project. The voting/selection algorithm should be rather simple.
    </p>
   
    <p class="entry"><b>January 27, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:</br>
      Began homework 2 (PCB exercise). Investigation into API candidates for music search and selection was
      begun. One candidate looks great: <a href="http://www.tinysong.com/api">Tinysong</a>.
      It's an appealing choice because it's simple (only 3 methods) and supports the functionality
      required for the device. A separate API would be necessary to get things like album art or other image
      materials (Tinysong appears to be text info only, hence the name).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      The first testing of the tinysong API was initiated. The code was inserted into the Django tutorial app
      and tested from the Django shell. The results look like this:<br>

      Attended lab with teammates. Refactoring of PSSC criteria was accomplished, and the PSSC's were
      informallly accepted. A Raspberry Pi was ordered and should arrive by Friday. Homework 2 (PCB tutorial)
      was completed, although singoff by the TA was not.

      Team meeting was held in lab for mandatory lab #5. Component selection feedback was received, and some 
      progress was made in part selection, especially in the previously lacking power supply and regulation
      components. It was determined that the power supply voltage should be higher than that which is required
      of the RaspberryPi (5V), so a 6.5V power supply was selected. In addition, it was decided that voltage 
      regulators would be included for both the Raspberry Pi and digital circuitry supplies. Another discussion
      centered around options for LED driving devices. A FET device and a constant current driver were the
      two discussed options, and a working FET-controlled LED design was supplied by George.
      Last, the workload for HW 4 was divided, with tha majority falling to Courtney, our resident packaging
      and mechanical design specialist. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 15, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Revision of homework 4 was completed prior to its submission by Courtney. After completion of the
      revision, some initial integration effort was begun. Tool acquisition and some cabling were begun with the
      intent to start programming the microcontroller with its MPLAB IDE and evaluation kit. The first microcontroller
      task will focus on the 3-wire serial peripheral in order to communicate with the serial port on the Raspberry
      Pi. A quick setback came in the form of a missing power supply for the evaluation kit. Joe promptly supplied one,
      further integration efforts will continue in the near future.

      A Django refresher from tutorials linked above was undertaken. A small modification of the existing webapp
      was made: there is now a basic Search button on the main page:
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-18-search-button-01.png">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-18-search-button-01.png" alt="screenshot1" height="200px" width="200px">

      </a> 
      <br>
      which performs a hard-coded call to tinysong API. This is a
      step closer to actually displaying search results in a meaningful manner. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 19, 2014 (2.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      Labratory attendance, as usual, was mandatory, and the focus was on schematic progress and/or issues. The
      discussion was led primarily by Courtney, who then assembled a list of outstanding concerns for later 
      resolution with course staff. The hardware narrative components were largely decided, and some division
      of labor was devised. Clarification on some peripheral responsibilities for the design was an additional 
      conversation topic. 
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 21, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>
      A team meeting was held to aid Sophie in completion of the hardware narrative report. An individual contribution 
      of the block diagram and design decisions was made. Microcontroller port assignments were the largest set of
      decisions to be made. Some physical/connection topics were discussed with respect to schematic completion. It 
      was tentativel decided that all necessary Raspberry Pi pins, control panel (pushbutton) pins, LCD pins, and motor
      pins would probably go to connectors on the PCB, since all aforementioned components will reside at specific
      location in the package (external to PCB, internal to packaging).
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 22, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      A more thorough setup by Matt of the Raspberry Pi workstation was facilitated. Access to the github repository
      was one initial accomplishment, as well as the acquiring of pre-built SPI python wrappers from 
      <a href="http://www.100randomtasks.com/simple-spi-on-raspberry-pi">100randomtasks.com</a>. <br>
      A preliminary visual inspection of the waveforms from the Raspberry Pi was promising, although a more scientific
      inspection will take place once it is more apparent how to operate some features on the MSO-X 4024A mixed-signal
      oscilloscope. <br>
      One unfortunate discovery came in the knowledge that the Raspberry Pi SPI harware does not support slave mode.
      See page 8 of the Raspberry PI CPU 
      <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf">datasheet</a>.
      This factor will play a part in refactoring the communication design and could potentially require a slight
      schematic modification. It is natural at this stage to develop SPI (slave) TX code on the PIC eval kit in order
      to communicate with (probably) functional SPI TX/RX code on the Raspberry Pi.<br><br>
      SPI investigation on the micro side was begun, and the initial plan of attaching SPI1 as
      master to SPI2 as a slave was undertaken.
      Unfortunately, somewhere in the inclusion of the SPI.h lib file and building, an error occurred in the build
      settings. At the moment, building and programming the micro is not functional. Instead, a good goal might be 
      one of the following: strive for some meaningul progress on the Django webapp or seek to modify the clock
      rate of Rpi SPI transmission. The next entry will likely detail efforts in one of those two categories.
    </p>

      Matt successfully navigated the maze of drivers and compilers to get the MPLab IDE up and running again. 
      A small plastic header was sacrificed and leads were soldered on to allow for scoping and interconnection
      of Raspberry Pi SPI signals. The ambitious experiment 
      of micro -> Rpi transmission was set up, whcih looked something like this:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-comm-ckt.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-comm-ckt.jpg" alt="serial comm" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      Before scoping anything, some software debugging was necessary. The MPLab spi library partially worked, but the 
      ReadSPI() function was loopinf infinitely. Replacing this function call with a regular IFG (interrupt flag) poll
      solved this looping issue. Although library dodumentation was unsurprisingly nonexistent, it is
      assumed that the library must have been for a slightly different device family.
      Logic analyzer probes were placed on SCLK, SIMO, and MOSI, but the only observable results were noisy, meaningless signals.
      Scoping each device's output separately determined that the Raspberry Pi clock and SPI lines were the culprits.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 25, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>
      Since the Rpi SPI was not operating correctly, a quick search was performed for alternatives for SPI
      driving code. The python example was abandoned, and a C programming example was discovered (linked within) from the following
      blog <a href="http://www.brianhensley.net/2012/07/getting-spi-working-on-raspberry-pi.html">tutorial</a>.<br>
      At this point, Rpi SPI was scoped alone; SUCCESS! See the code and initial results here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-rpi.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-rpi.jpg" alt="rpi" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> 
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-serial-code.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-serial-code.jpg" alt="code" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      Some additional code was authored to display (on the microcontroller) multi-byte transmissions from the Rpi.
      In addition, clock frequencies were matched to facilitate what will eventually be bidirectional communication.
      See evidence of frequency (62.5KHz) matching here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-adjusted-freq.jpg">
	<img src="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-adjusted-freq.jpg" alt="code" height="200px" width="200px">
      </a> <br>
      This experiment was successful! (Multiple transmissions, one way: Rpi -> micro)
      It was briefly noted that since Rpi SPI peripherals are all master-mode hardware, a switching
      protocol must be developed in software on the micro side so that it may
      operate in Master or Slave mode as appropriate to each SPI peripheral (Rpi, LCD).

      Mandatory Lab was held. Descussion centered around streaming API selection and different options. Tinysong
      (the current metadata API) returns a link to Grooveshark flash music player, but that will not suffice for 
      Rpi streaming due to system incompatibilites. Grooveshark's streaming API would be the best option, but
      it is unclear whether API key access will be granted. Should the Grooveshark API prove inaccessible, 
      two main alternatives methods were selected, in order of team preference:<br>
      - Anonymizing Grooveshark API calls with TOR to allow for previously issued keys to be reused<br>
      - Downloading youtube videos, ripping out audio on the fly, and playing from disk

      Today's session resulted in the completion of the initial PCB layout and the submission of homework 6 (PCB Layout).
      From the existing layout, many changes were made. Among the highlights are:<br>
      - Switching from BJT motor control circuitry to the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf">L239D Motor Driver</a> IC<br>
      - Reassigning several incorrect pin assignments from the microcontroller to the LED driver<br>
      - Changing to a 6-pin RJ-11 connector and routing programming pins correctly<br>
      - Routing power and ground to microcontoller bypass capacitors<br>
      - Creating all power and ground planes<br>
      The report for homework #6 was completed in parallel to the PCB layout activities.

        differentiate between li tags on different pages
      - something to keep in mind - don't try to print out POST data that's not there (maybe I should divide up vote fcn)
      - some initial testing and monkey clicking shows that I should probably account for songs with the same titles, maybe
      simply by providing more information on the home page
      - timeout for vote spamming?
      - added vote down functionality, with another hidden POST element that pipes to vote() function/view
      - error when switching WIFI networks on my virtual machine. watch out for that in the future
      - tested voting, can't go negative, looks good for now
      - now i got a response from ane external request by implementing a simple headless view, but I don't
        know exactly what text will be most useful here, it has to be straight string data
      - right now, I'll just leave it as ISO string data rep of the song title (HttpResponse object limitations)
      - researched deploying the webapp on the Rpi, found two good candidates 
      <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=7208&p=403771">here</a> and
      <a href="http://blog.mattwoodward.com/2013/01/setting-up-django-on-raspberry-pi.html">here</a>
      - more today - LCD stuff with matt. we got rid of some erroneous parallel setup command sequences and stuck to 
        purely serial commands, now we're getting more meaningful results, got a checkerboard to display, but it 
        looks like we're manipulating memory really manually, not exactly what we want. 
      - researched and selected an 8x8 bit font to use in SPI LCD character transmission (yes, every letter)
      - we did A and printed it AAAAAAAH - picture
      - problem was not enough current and never resetting page and column positions after ram clear/checkerboard
      - bug in initial vote now

      I forget what day, but I found groove.py and it's very helpful, although we're violating GS TOS, probs

      showed mostly-functional webapp to group members, good feedback/reception
      still needs CSS to beautify, but I'm still adding functionality
      briefly assisted in getting PCB finalized and checked off, but mostly Matt and Court

      - need to do some startup webapp stuff to check for the correct libraries like pthon requests
      - could potentially deploy using google's app engine, but we might need to work aroung the python requests lib (won't be installed)
      - the IDs from groove.py and tinysong appear to line up, so I can probably skip the user portion of groove.py and just use the back end
      - modified the django 'api' to respond with the top 5 current songIds, comma delimited
      - added a small layer of security, a GET data check in order to request next song
      - added a bag of sorts to eliminate re-downloading of songs by groove.py, working well so far
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>March 19, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:<br>
      - researched deployment strategies, Google app engine looks like a good one, so I created a project to play with
      - google tutorial <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql/django">here</a>
      - google's SQL instance is NOT FREE, so we have two evident other options: 
           1) work with django-nonrel to sit totally on top of google app engine, less integration, more project setup
           <a href="django-nonrel.org">nonrel</a>
           2) try to get django and nginx and IP forwarding figured out on the rpi itself (slightly more favorable)

      - modifying groove.py to be much more autonomous and headless, need to add playback functionality, maybe with mpg123 unix lib
      - tweaked requestNext api call to include 'pull' arg (GET) depending on whether we immediately need a new song or not
      - tested mpg123 for mp3 playback on rpi - works!

    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>March 21, 2014 ( hours)</b>:<br>
      - added bitmapped letters thru p for lcd (micro code)
      - incorporated a second subprocess call to provide music playback, harcoded, while doing requests every 10 seconds

      reconvened with team, caught up on spring break work
      agenda and list of crap to do yet
      discussed SPI request/response protocol
      peer evaluations

      spi talking bidirectional again, got ISR to fire
      linked spi and LCD calls (picture would be nice)
      
      got multiprocess playback working in a simple way
       - switched to -R interface for mpg123
       - was getting a terminal setting error message, using -R changes interaction pattern
      determined that rpi deployment of webapp will probably be sufficient after testing preformance
      
    </p>
    <p class="entry"><b>March 25, 2014 ( hours)</b>:<br>
      wrote and called a dummy a.out to prove that I could, and I can check its output too,
      this will probabl be how we interact with the spi c file on the rpi
