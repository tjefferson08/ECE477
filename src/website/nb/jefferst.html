    <h1>Travis Jefferson's Lab Notebook</h1>

    <h3 id="week01">Week 01</h3>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 14, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br>Initialized github repo with stubs for directories and blank
      notebook templates.
    </p>

    <p class="entry"><b>January 15, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br>Began a Django web application tutorial, put it under version
      control 
      (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/">step 1</a>) 
    </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 15, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:
      <br>Met as a team after class to finish writing preliminary
      project proposal.
    </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 16, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:
      <br>Continued working through Django tutorial 
      (<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 2</a>)
    </p>
    
    <p class="summary"><b>WEEK 01 SUMMARY</b><br>
                       <u>Accomplishments</u>: Submitted preliminary project proposal.<br>
                       <u>Weekly Work Total</u>: 5 hours<br>
                       <u>Project Work Total</u>: 5 hours<br>
    </p>
                       
    <p class="entry"><b>January 19, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Got on team account, put all team webpage materials under 
      version control.
      The repo was then reorganized and a bash script was authored to aid in staging/testing website changes in the 
      repo, then exporting them to the live hosting environment. More work will probably be involved when the same
      task is undertaken for the webapp's resources. A thought: it might be the case that the limited hosting 
      feature
      set provided by ECN will not be sufficient for the functionality required from the Every1 DJ webapp
    </p>                    
    
    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:
      <br> Finished Django tutorial
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 2</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 2 focused on the Django-generated admin pages for each specific application
      runing on a site. So far, it will likely be sufficient to run a single app to power the project's needs.
      At the end, the step 2 tutorial previewed the template with which the user can modify the way in which the 
      python-powered content is displayed in HTML/CSS. This feature is the focus of step 3.

    <p class="entry"><b>January 22, 2014 (1.5 hours)</b>:
      <br> Completed Django tutorial 
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial03/">step 3</a>
       and committed to repo. Switched mid-tutorial to the latest Django tutorial version (1.6); that's also what
      is installed on the development machines. Began some simple view authoring and intro to the Django template
      language. Brainstorming was briefly undertaken as to a potential data model for the song selection/sorting
      as well as storage. Atomic data element will probably be a song, with multiple attributes and views.

      <br> Finished Django tutorial
      <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial02/">step 4</a>
       and committed to repo. Step 4 included a form to calculate voting on polls, as well 
      as a switch from distinct and hardcoded to generic, flexible templates.
