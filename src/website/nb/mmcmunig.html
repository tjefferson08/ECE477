		During this activity a switching power supply circuit was duplicated using the National Semiconductor

   		   	was loaded onto the formated SD card. <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/Raspbian"> Raspbian OS</a> was chosen based
   		   	on user reviews, capabilities and documentation. The OS was then installed and the RPI became functional!
   		   	The wifi configuration was modified and some time was spent exploring the existing applications. A HDMI to VGA
   		   	converter was purchased to avoid having to use living room tv. A USB hub was also purchased to allow a mouse and
   		   	keyboard to be used while the wifi dongle is attached.</p>

       		<p class="entry"><b>February 12, 2013 (2 hour)</b>:<br> During the required lab we reviewed our progress with Homework 4 and continued to finalized our parts list. 
       		It was pointed out by the TA's that the parts list was missing components related to power. After the discussion regulators and a power
       		supply were added to the list. Some components have been added and others will continue to be purchased. </p> 
       		
       		<p class="entry"><b>February 14, 2013 (1.5 hour)</b>:<br>  Homework 4 was thoroughly reviewed and modified after receiving some negative feedback on Homework 3.
       		Once the team was satisfied with the report and it had been turned in the attention was shifted to the test board provided by Joe. 
       		Time was spent reviewing a tutorial and online help for the MPLAB IDE. Unfortunately we did not have a power supply for the micro
       		during this time so there wasn't much of an accomplishment. The short term goal is communicate between the Raspberry Pi and Micro through
       		serial. </p> 
       		
       		<p class="entry"><b>February 15, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br>
      		After receiving the correct power supply from Joe it was time to set up the MPLAB IDE and attempt to run a test program on the micro.
      		Most of this time was spent reading online help forums trying to get the IDE to compile a program and recognize the MPLAB ICD 3 in-circuit debugger.
      		It was discovered that a separate C compiler must be installed and selected, instead of coming with the program as expected. The issue with the ICD 3
      		turned out to be diver incompatibility between different versions of the MPLAB ICD software. Finally, a test program was compiled and programmed on the micro.<br>

      During mandatory lab session there were discussions with the course staff regarding the schematic and Homework 5 as a whole. 
      Work continued on the hardware narrative homework and individual sections were assigned within the group. Continuing from the success of
      getting MPLAB IDE successfully working the team created a test program to blink the LED's on the PIC development board. This may not be a huge
      accomplishment but it was exciting to finally see the microcontroller perform some 'action'. <br>

	  Continued to work on Homework 5, hardware narrative. This included research on the communication data rates available between the microcontroller
	  and other components such as <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/699/what-spi-frequencies-does-raspberry-pi-support">Raspberry Pi</a>
	   and the <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCA9626.pdf">LED Driver</a>. 

    <p class="entry"><b>February 21, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      A team meeting was held to continue progress on the hardware narrative report. Much of the time was dedicated to coming to a consensus
      regarding the port assignments for each of the subsystems. It was decided that the internal oscillator would be used for the microcontroller
      and a frequency of 4MHz was chosen. Using scalers the appropriate clock speed will be attained for each of the peripherals.

    <p class="entry"><b>February 22, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>
      Research was conducted to better understand the steps necessary to successfully stream a song using the GrooveShark API.
      It was discovered that Grooveshark is pretty strict on their licensing laws:
      <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/tuts/streaming">Grooveshark Streaming</a>. and an API key was requested. <br>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>February 22, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>
      The Raspberry Pi was set up at the team station for our first test of the SPI ports. After once again struggling
      with the wifi adapter for the RaspberryPi an ethernet connection was established and the github repository was
      successfully cloned on the rpi. Using the SPI python walkthrough provided by  <a href="http://www.100randomtasks.com/simple-spi-on-raspberry-pi">100randomtasks.com</a>
      the serial ports showed some activity. No specific values were successfully read or written but that is the next goal.

      SPI successful, scoped (img here)
      Overcame a while loop stuck in a lib function, we just wrote our own listening code
      More problems with the damn IDE toolchain
      Soldered a prototyping connector to connect micro jumper port and Rpi header pins

      The focus of today's work session was once again to communicate between the microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi using SPI. 
      After confirming that the Raspberry Pi must be the master in the SPI master slave interface, a successful array of data was sent
      from the raspberry pi to the microcontroller and stored in a buffer. The signals were viewed using a logic analyzer to confirm the correct
      clock rate (62.5MHz) and the data being sent.
