       		<p class="entry"><b>February 12, 2013 (2 hour)</b>:<br> During the required lab we reviewed our progress with Homework 4 and continued to finalized our parts list. 
       		It was pointed out by the TA's that the parts list was missing components related to power. After the discussion regulators and a power
       		supply were added to the list. Some components have been added and others will continue to be purchased. </p> 
       		
       		<p class="entry"><b>February 14, 2013 (1.5 hour)</b>:<br>  Homework 4 was thoroughly reviewed and modified after receiving some negative feedback on Homework 3.
       		Once the team was satisfied with the report and it had been turned in the attention was shifted to the test board provided by Joe. 
       		Time was spent reviewing a tutorial and online help for the MPLAB IDE. Unfortunately we did not have a power supply for the micro
       		during this time so there wasn't much of an accomplishment. The short term goal is communicate between the Raspberry Pi and Micro through
       		serial. </p>

      		After receiving the correct power supply from Joe it was time to set up the MPLAB IDE and attempt to run a test program on the micro.
      		Most of this time was spent reading online help forums trying to get the IDE to compile a program and recognize the MPLAB ICD 3 in-circuit debugger.
      		It was discovered that a separate C compiler must be installed and selected, instead of coming with the program as expected. The issue with the ICD 3
      		turned out to be diver incompatibility between different versions of the MPLAB ICD software. Finally, a test program was compiled and programmed on the micro.<br>

      During mandatory lab session there were discussions with the course staff regarding the schematic and Homework 5 as a whole. 
      Work continued on the hardware narrative homework and individual sections were assigned within the group. Continuing from the success of
      getting MPLAB IDE successfully working the team created a test program to blink the LED's on the PIC development board. This may not be a huge
      accomplishment but it was exciting to finally see the microcontroller perform some 'action'. <br>

	  Continued to work on Homework 5, hardware narrative. This included research on the communication data rates available between the microcontroller
	  and other components such as <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/699/what-spi-frequencies-does-raspberry-pi-support">Raspberry Pi</a>
	   and the <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCA9626.pdf">LED Driver</a>.

      A team meeting was held to continue progress on the hardware narrative report. Much of the time was dedicated to coming to a consensus
      regarding the port assignments for each of the subsystems. It was decided that the internal oscillator would be used for the microcontroller
      and a frequency of 4MHz was chosen. Using scalers the appropriate clock speed will be attained for each of the peripherals.

      Research was conducted to better understand the steps necessary to successfully stream a song using the GrooveShark API.
      It was discovered that Grooveshark is pretty strict on their licensing laws:
      <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/tuts/streaming">Grooveshark Streaming</a>. and an API key was requested. <br>

      The Raspberry Pi was set up at the team station for our first test of the SPI ports. After once again struggling
      with the wifi adapter for the RaspberryPi an ethernet connection was established and the github repository was
      successfully cloned on the rpi. Using the SPI python walkthrough provided by  <a href="http://www.100randomtasks.com/simple-spi-on-raspberry-pi">100randomtasks.com</a>
      the serial ports showed some activity. No specific values were successfully read or written but that is the next goal.

    	After overcoming more problems with the MPLAB IDE software the SPI communication was tested using
    	predefined SPI write and read functions. When this was unsuccessful the functions were abandoned and
    	new code was written to manually check the SPI flags and fill the SPI buffer. <br>
        A header was soldered for the Raspberry Pi SPI pins in order to easily connect them to the PIC
        development board pins.  </p>

      The focus of today's work session was once again to communicate between the microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi using SPI. 
      After confirming that the Raspberry Pi must be the master in the SPI master slave interface, a successful array of data was sent
      from the raspberry pi to the microcontroller and stored in a buffer. The signals were viewed using a logic analyzer to confirm the correct
      clock rate (62.5MHz) and the data being sent. <br>

      The lab discussion was concerned with audio streaming and API selection. Grooveshark's streaming
      API appears to be the best option however a session key is required by Grooveshark and it has
      been weeks without a reply from them. Other options were explored in the event that we are not
      able to use Grooveshark. These other options included paying for a spotify account in order to 
      use their streaming API, for downloading video's from youtube and using the audio from them. The latter
      is not preferred.

    <p class="entry"><b>February 27, 2014 (6 hours)</b>:<br>
      Upon inspection of the existing PCB layout, it was determined that all of the different voltages (3.3V, 5V, 12V) were connected together in the schematic and the PCB board. 
      This turned out to be a huge fix since nearly every power and ground trace need to be re-routed. The trace widths were changed for all power and 
      ground signals since previously they had all been set to 12 mil which is much to small for the amount of current required. It was discovered that 
      we had no connector for the power supply so the appropriate 3.5mm female connector was found in eagle and added to the layout. <br>
      The PCB board at the conclusion of the days work: <br>

    	The goal of today was to complete the initial PCB layout required for Homework 06. In order to 
    	complete the board the BJT circuitry for the motor control was replaced by a 
    	<a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf">L239D Motor Driver</a>. The RJ-11 connector
    	needed to be connected to the programming pins of the microcontroller. Power and ground planes were
    	added to the board. Separate analog and digital ground planes were create in order to keep the signals
    	divided except for a single point. Finally power and ground pins needed to be routed to the existing 
    	bypass capacitors. 
      	The initial version of the PCB layout can be viewed below:<br>

    	Last week data was successfully sent from the Raspberry Pi to the microcontroller via SPI.
    	Today the focus was to send data bidirectionally. After gaining a better understanding of the SPI
    	peripheral it was determined the SPI was being opened in the wrong mode. Once this was changed
    	there was a successful transfer of data to and from the microcontroller. It was also discovered that
    	the microcontroller uses the same buffer for sending and receiving SPI data.  
    	<br>
  		After the successful SPI transmission the focus was shifted to the schematic and pcb board. A 0 Ohm
		resistor was added between analog and digital ground. This allows the ground to stay separated during testing
		then joined together. Current limiting resistors were added between the LED driver and each of the LED header
		ins. The MPlab reference sheet was used to correctly connect the RJ-11 connector which will be used to program
		the microcontroller. A new power supply connector was created and added to the pcb board.
		<br>
		All of the parts that had been modified in the schematic were re-routed in the board. The power and ground
		trace widths were increased wherever possible. <br>
		Below was the state of the board at the completion of the night: <br>

      Updated PCB board with parts and connections that changed as a result of the design review. The ground plane that had
      been created was not named appropriately and therefore was not actually connected to ground. This was fixed as well as adding 
      rank to different planes in order to avoid overlapping.  <br>
      
      An LED was tested using a 5V input in order to determine if 100mA current would be enough for the 
      red, green, and blue LEDs. Using a piece of paper as eye protection the results were successful!

      Power components continue to change as we find new requirements that had previously been overlooked. The footprint of the bulk capacitors were
      much too small. <br>
      Audio drivers were installed on the Raspberry Pi. A few settings such as output volume and output device were modified. The audio originally
      is set to output from HDMI and this was changed to analog output. A wav file was downloaded and successfully played on powered speakers.
      When the oscilloscope was set up to view the output on headphone wires nothing but noise was heard.

      Worked on getting LCD to turn on and display anything.Each command was analyzed using the oscilloscope

	  It was discovered that the reason the screen lit up once earlier in the day but had appeared
      'off' since then was due to the entire RAM space in the LCD being initialized to 0. When the LCDwrite module tried to
      write a character the starting column and row were not reset to 0, but were instead at the very end of the RAM space 
      (not visible on the LCD). Once this was fixed the LCD was successfully initialized and data was displayed. <br>

      The schematic was updated with the final power and audio circuitry components. The component changes included
      using one stepper voltage regulator for 12V to 5V and one LDO for 5V to 3.3V. All of the bulk capacitors had been
      changed to correctly match the part footprint. The diodes were changed to surface mount. <br>
      Once these parts had been finalized on the schematic the board routing began. The layout of the voltage regulator
      followed the data sheet recommendation as closely as possible. The audio circuitry was kept compact and separate
      from the other components due to it having and anlog ground. The trace widths for power and ground were kept wide to 
      avoid overheating with the high current requirements. Vias were added to connect the ground plans on the top and 
      bottom.

     	A team meeting was held to review our current progress and to assign tasks going forward. Once the
     	managerial work was complete the commands sent between the Raspberry Pi and microcontroller via SPI 
     	were established. The Raspberry Pi will send a heartbeat message every 100ms(?). When a push button
     	microcontroller is pressed requesting a new song the microcontroller will load a Next Song Request character
     	into its SPI buffer. When the Raspberry Pi receives this special command character it will load the 
     	song meta data into its buffer to be send on the next 100ms transmission. The microcontroller will be expecting
     	the song data this time and will load the song name, artist, album, and year into global variables. These
     	global variables will be used to populate the LCD.

    	The SPI testing circuit was reconstructed. Once bidirectional communication was confirmed
    	the correct interrupt registers were initialized in order to have the SPI communication fire the 
    	Interrupt Service Routine (ISR). Inside this ISR the LCD initialization module was called. The LCD
    	was not successfully turned on from this call.

      The focus for today was to identify all of the registers necessary for the peripheral
      initializations. These peripherals include SPI, I2C, PWM, ADC, Timer, and Push Buttons. 
      The register bits were also identified for the necessary interrupts and flags. <br>

      Today Meyer confirmed that our audio beat detection circuity appeared to be correct. This is where the
      good news ended as multiple pins were discovered to be routed incorrectly. The I2C clock and data pins were
      connected to general I/O pins instead of the specified locations. It was also discovered that Vss/Vdd were
      swapped in one location. After discussing the news with the team it was determined the pins could be manually
      re-routed and a new board might not be necessary.
      <br> 
      More bad news came when two different parts that were shipped during spring break did not match their 
      footprint on the PCB board. The correct version of the parts will need to be researched and ordered ASAP.

      Work on the software narrative continued. Much of today was spent getting a better understanding of the ADC and PWM
      peripherals for our PIC18. Four PWM modules will be used in full-bridge mode to power the motor driver IC. The ADC module
      will sample the audio out from the Raspberry Pi a certain number of times and return the total over the time giving a value
      representing beats per minute.

      Today's accomplishments were very disappointing for the amount of time spent. The goal of today was
      to finish up SPI testing and move on to I2C communication between the microcontroller and the LED driver.
      Once the test circuit was set up even simple communication between the Raspberry Pi and microcontroller were
      no longer working. After spending a great deal of time debugging it was determined that the oscilloscope 
      connecters were causing the signals to be tied high. It was not determined why this was the cause
      but once the connector was switched the communication was close to the expected output. It was also
      discovered that the ribbon cable made for our Raspberry Pi serial connectors had 1 pin that was not operating 
      correctly. Once these issues were dealt with the SPI communication was finally working again. However, the
      LCD was not operating as expected anymore. After unsuccessfully debugging the LCD connections I2C sample code
      was written but not tested yet.

      After yesterday's disappointing testing today was more productive. The reason for the LCD not working
      as expected was discovered to be 'noise' from the Raspberry Pi connections. Since all SPI share a clock
      this is a serious issue. Once the Raspberry Pi connector was unplugged the LCD was once again turing on and
      displaying characters. The LCD function was enhanced to allow strings as arguments from main. I2C communicaiton
      was tested today and after addressing a few issues was successful. The primary issue for I2C was having to clear
      the interrupt flag in software since it was not done in hardware like many other interrupts. <br>

      Finally the ADC module was written and tested. After reviewing the datasheet thoroughly the results of the 
      A/D conversion do not seem to be completely accurate. <br>

 	<p class="entry"><b>April 2, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br> During mandatory lab it was decided that a new board would be design in order to fix 
 	issues with I2C connections and to recreate the audio circuit after testing. The audio circuit was tested and many issues were discovered with 	the gain and envelope detection. After deciding the LCD would now be controlled via I2C on the new PCB board layout, the LCD was successfully tested
 	using the I2C peripheral:

	<p class="entry"><b>April 3, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>  After working with the course staff the audio circuit was producing meaningful output.
	However, instead of using the envelop detection it was determined that the audio would simply be tested after the op-amp. The sensitivity of
	the beat detection can be modified through a potentiometer. The result can be viewed below.<br>

    <p class="entry"><b>April 6, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br> A goal for this week is to prototype the LED driver. A basic test program was designed
    and coded to light up a single light. In order to successfully do this multiple control registers on the LED driver needed to be initialized 
    and the individual LED PWM register needed to be greater than 0. It was discussed that the group blinking and dimming registers would be used
    in the future once more LEDs were connected. 
    </p>

  
    
    <p class="entry"><b>April 7, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br> LED driver was soldered to a breakout board in order to begin prototyping. The soldered
    pin connections were not correct the first or second time and were corrected. After brief testing there was no noticeable light on the LED.
    </p>

    
    
    
    <p class="entry"><b>April 8, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br> Prototyping of the LED driver was resumed. After modifying the initialization of the 
    LED driver and still having no success, the I2C data and clock signals were scoped. The address signal was being ACK'd by the LED driver 
    but the other control signals were being NACK'd.
    
    <p class="entry"><b>April 9, 2014 (3.5 hours)</b>:<br>Worked on trying to get the LED driver to control an LED. At first, there were no acknoledgments from the i2c protocol. This was debugged by making sure all values being sent from the microcontroller to the LED driver were correct. It was found after digging into the datasheet and online examples that the reset sequence being implemented was not correct. Once this was fixed, acknoledgements were visible on the oscilloscope. While all the correct data seems to be sent correctly, the output of the LED is never set high and the LED never turns on. After a few hours of debugging by changing resistor values, supply voltage, etc., no luck was sought.

      <b>April 9, 2014 (3 hours)</b>:<br> Worked on debugging of I2C on the LED's. It seemed that instead of receiving acks, the driver was nacking. This was changed by making sure all grounds were connected from the microcontroller to the LED driver. Still no changes seen in the output of the LED driver. Perhaps there are problems with the soldering job. This testing will continue when the LED driver is soldered to the PCB, to ensure all connections are correct.</p>

      <b>April 10, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br> Worked on wiring the motor driver. The origional design for motor control did not include a PLD, which the team now thinks is necessary. A PLD was obtained from the parts room, and a programmer. The PLD code was completed using a truth table to toggle the four outputs to make the motor spin. This worked correctly, as the motor spun at variable speens depending on how quickly the toggles occured. <br>

We then discussed with Joe about using a PLD when it wasn't currently on the PCB. He suggested that instead of a PLD, an interrupt triggered truth table could be used. This way, no fly wiring would need to be done to attach a PLD and all code could sit on the microcontroller. This was completed and the motor spins at variable speeds depending on how quickly the truth table gets set. Below is a video of the motor spinning with enough torque to spin the disco ball.
