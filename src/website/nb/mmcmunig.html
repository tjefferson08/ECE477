       		<p class="entry"><b>February 12, 2013 (2 hour)</b>:<br> During the required lab we reviewed our progress with Homework 4 and continued to finalized our parts list. 
       		It was pointed out by the TA's that the parts list was missing components related to power. After the discussion regulators and a power
       		supply were added to the list. Some components have been added and others will continue to be purchased. </p> 
       		
       		<p class="entry"><b>February 14, 2013 (1.5 hour)</b>:<br>  Homework 4 was thoroughly reviewed and modified after receiving some negative feedback on Homework 3.
       		Once the team was satisfied with the report and it had been turned in the attention was shifted to the test board provided by Joe. 
       		Time was spent reviewing a tutorial and online help for the MPLAB IDE. Unfortunately we did not have a power supply for the micro
       		during this time so there wasn't much of an accomplishment. The short term goal is communicate between the Raspberry Pi and Micro through
       		serial. </p>

      		After receiving the correct power supply from Joe it was time to set up the MPLAB IDE and attempt to run a test program on the micro.
      		Most of this time was spent reading online help forums trying to get the IDE to compile a program and recognize the MPLAB ICD 3 in-circuit debugger.
      		It was discovered that a separate C compiler must be installed and selected, instead of coming with the program as expected. The issue with the ICD 3
      		turned out to be diver incompatibility between different versions of the MPLAB ICD software. Finally, a test program was compiled and programmed on the micro.<br>

      During mandatory lab session there were discussions with the course staff regarding the schematic and Homework 5 as a whole. 
      Work continued on the hardware narrative homework and individual sections were assigned within the group. Continuing from the success of
      getting MPLAB IDE successfully working the team created a test program to blink the LED's on the PIC development board. This may not be a huge
      accomplishment but it was exciting to finally see the microcontroller perform some 'action'. <br>

	  Continued to work on Homework 5, hardware narrative. This included research on the communication data rates available between the microcontroller
	  and other components such as <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/699/what-spi-frequencies-does-raspberry-pi-support">Raspberry Pi</a>
	   and the <a href="http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCA9626.pdf">LED Driver</a>. 

    <p class="entry"><b>February 21, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>
      A team meeting was held to continue progress on the hardware narrative report. Much of the time was dedicated to coming to a consensus
      regarding the port assignments for each of the subsystems. It was decided that the internal oscillator would be used for the microcontroller
      and a frequency of 4MHz was chosen. Using scalers the appropriate clock speed will be attained for each of the peripherals.

      Research was conducted to better understand the steps necessary to successfully stream a song using the GrooveShark API.
      It was discovered that Grooveshark is pretty strict on their licensing laws:
      <a href="http://developers.grooveshark.com/tuts/streaming">Grooveshark Streaming</a>. and an API key was requested. <br>

      The Raspberry Pi was set up at the team station for our first test of the SPI ports. After once again struggling
      with the wifi adapter for the RaspberryPi an ethernet connection was established and the github repository was
      successfully cloned on the rpi. Using the SPI python walkthrough provided by  <a href="http://www.100randomtasks.com/simple-spi-on-raspberry-pi">100randomtasks.com</a>
      the serial ports showed some activity. No specific values were successfully read or written but that is the next goal.

      The focus of today's work session was once again to communicate between the microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi using SPI. 
      After confirming that the Raspberry Pi must be the master in the SPI master slave interface, a successful array of data was sent
      from the raspberry pi to the microcontroller and stored in a buffer. The signals were viewed using a logic analyzer to confirm the correct
      clock rate (62.5MHz) and the data being sent. <br>
      The setup that was used to test SPI communications:

      Since the Rpi SPI was not operating correctly, a quick search was performed for alternatives for SPI
      driving code. The python example was abandoned, and a C programming example was discovered (linked within) from the following
      blog <a href="http://www.brianhensley.net/2012/07/getting-spi-working-on-raspberry-pi.html">tutorial</a>.<br>
      At this point, Rpi SPI was scoped alone; SUCCESS! See the code and initial results here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-serial-rpi.jpg">

      </a> <br>
      Some additional code was authored to display (on the microcontroller) multi-byte transmissions from the Rpi.
      In addition, clock frequencies were matched to facilitate what will eventually be bidirectional communication.
      See evidence of frequency (62.5KHz) matching here:<br>
      <a href="../images/jefferst/2014-02-25-rpi-adjusted-freq.jpg">

      </a> <br>
      This experiment was successful! (Multiple transmissions, one way: Rpi -> micro)
      It was briefly noted that since Rpi SPI peripherals are all master-mode hardware, a switching
      protocol must be developed in software on the micro side so that it may
      operate in Master or Slave mode as appropriate to each SPI peripheral (Rpi, LCD).

      Mandatory Lab was held. Descussion centered around streaming API selection and different options. Tinysong
      (the current metadata API) returns a link to Grooveshark flash music player, but that will not suffice for 
      Rpi streaming due to system incompatibilites. Grooveshark's streaming API would be the best option, but
      it is unclear whether API key access will be granted. Should the Grooveshark API prove inaccessible, 
      two main alternatives methods were selected, in order of team preference:<br>
      - Anonymizing Grooveshark API calls with TOR to allow for previously issued keys to be reused<br>
      - Downloading youtube videos, ripping out audio on the fly, and playing from disk

      Upon inspection of the existing PCB layout, it was determined that all of the different voltages (3.3V, 5V, 12V) were connected together in the schematic and the PCB board. 
      This turned out to be a huge fix since nearly every power and ground trace need to be re-routed. The trace widths were changed for all power and 
      ground signals since previously they had all been set to 12 mil which is much to small for the amount of current required. It was discovered that 
      we had no connector for the power supply so the appropriate 3.5mm female connector was found in eagle and added to the layout. <br>
      The PCB board at the conclusion of the days work: <br>

      Today's session resulted in the completion of the initial PCB layout and the submission of homework 6 (PCB Layout).
      From the existing layout, many changes were made. Among the highlights are:<br>
      - Switching from BJT motor control circuitry to the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf">L239D Motor Driver</a> IC<br>
      - Reassigning several incorrect pin assignments from the microcontroller to the LED driver<br>
      - Changing to a 6-pin RJ-11 connector and routing programming pins correctly<br>
      - Routing power and ground to microcontoller bypass capacitors<br>
      - Creating all power and ground planes<br>
      The report for homework #6 was completed in parallel to the PCB layout activities.

      Updated PCB board with parts and connections that changed as a result of the design review. The ground plane that had
      been created was not named appropriately and therefore was not actually connected to ground. This was fixed as well as adding 
      rank to different planes in order to avoid overlapping.

      Power components continue to change as we find new requirements that had previously been overlooked. The footprint of the bulk capacitors were
      much too small.
      Audio drivers were installed on the Raspberry Pi. A few settings such as output volume and output device were modified. The audio originally
      is set to output from HDMI and this was changed to analog output. A wav file was downloaded and successfully played on powered speakers.
      When the oscilloscope was set up to view the output on headphone wires nothing but noise was heard.

      Worked on getting LCD to turn on and display anything.Each command was analyzed using the oscilloscope 
      and appeared to be sent correctly and in the right order. Was able to briefly get some random pixels to light
      up but even this stopped working. <br>

	  It was discovered that the reason the screen lit up once earlier in the day but had appeared
      'off' since then was due to the entire RAM space in the LCD being initialized to 0. When the LCDwrite module tried to
      write a character the starting column and row were not reset to 0, but were instead at the very end of the RAM space 
      (not visible on the LCD). Once this was fixed the LCD was successfully initialized and data was displayed. <br>

      The schematic was updated with the final power and audio circuitry components. The component changes included
      using one stepper voltage regulator for 12V to 5V and one LDO for 5V to 3.3V. All of the bulk capacitors had been
      changed to correctly match the part footprint. The diodes were changed to surface mount. <br>
      Once these parts had been finalized on the schematic the board routing began. The layout of the voltage regulator
      followed the data sheet recommendation as closely as possible. The audio circuitry was kept compact and separate
      from the other components due to it having and anlog ground. The trace widths for power and ground were kept wide to 
      avoid overheating with the high current requirements. Vias were added to connect the ground plans on the top and 
      bottom.

     	A team meeting was held to review our current progress and to assign tasks going forward. Once the
     	managerial work was complete the SPI 
      reconvened with team, caught up on spring break work
      agenda and list of crap to do yet
      discussed SPI request/response protocol
      peer evaluations

      The focus of today's time spent in lab was understanding the ADC and PWM modules.

      Today's accomplishments were very disappointing for the amount of time spent. The goal of today was
      to finish up SPI testing and move on to I2C communication between the microcontroller and the LED driver.
      Once the test circuit was set up even simple communication between the Raspberry Pi and microcontroller were
      no longer working. After spending a great deal of time debugging it was determined that the oscilloscope 
      connecters were causing the signals to be tied high. It was not determined why this was the cause
      but once the connector was switched the communication was close to the expected output. It was also
      discovered that the ribbon cable made for our Raspberry Pi serial connectors had 1 pin that was not operating 
      correctly. Once these issues were dealt with the SPI communication was finally working again. However, the
      LCD was not operating as expected anymore. After unsuccessfully debugging the LCD connections I2C sample code
      was written but not tested yet.

      After yesterday's disappointing testing today was more productive. The reason for the LCD not working
      as expected was discovered to be 'noise' from the Raspberry Pi connections. Since all SPI share a clock
      this is a serious issue. Once the Raspberry Pi connector was unplugged the LCD was once again turing on and
      displaying characters. The LCD function was enhanced to allow strings as arguments from main. I2C communicaiton
      was tested today and after addressing a few issues was successful. The primary issue for I2C was having to clear
      the interrupt flag in software since it was not done in hardware like many other interrupts. Finally the ADC module
      was written and tested. After reviewing the datasheet thoroughly the results of the A/D conversion does not seem to be
      completely accurate.
