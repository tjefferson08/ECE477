		<p class="entry"><b>January 28, 2013 (2 hour)</b>:<br>Started Homework 2, PCB design exercise.
		During this activity a switching power supply circuit was duplicated using the National Semiconductor 
		LM2675. The transition from schematic to board proved difficult and needed the assistance of TA to complete. </p>

		<p class="entry"><b>January 39, 2013 (1.5 hour)</b>:<br> During weekly lab final PSSC's were informallly accepted. 
		A Raspberry Pi was ordered and should arrive within two days.</p>

   		   	<p class="entry"><b>February 8, 2013 (3 hour)</b>:<br> Received Raspberry Pi from teammate and began
   		   	steps to load an OS. <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">New Out Of Box Software (NOOBS)</a> 
   		   	was loaded onto the formated SD card. <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/Raspbian"> Raspbian OS</a> was chosen based
   		   	on user reviews, capabilities and documentation. The OS was then installed and the RPI became functional!
   		   	The wifi configuration was modified and some time was spent exploring the existing applications. A HDMI to VGA
   		   	converter was purchased to avoid having to use living room tv. A USB hub was also purchased to allow a mouse and
   		   	keyboard to be used while the wifi dongle is attached.</p>
