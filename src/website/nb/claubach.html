    <p class="entry"><b>February 5, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br> Came up with multiple options of how to build the mechanical design of the project that are listed below with links to the project description.<br>
    
Option 1 (use this and cut holes out of plastic -> towards idea of rotating disco ball or use a wiffle ball): http://www.nationalbuildersupply.com/progress-lighting-white-1+light-post-light-p5446+60/p12892?utm_source=shopping&utm_medium=cse&utm_campaign=Progress%20Lighting&utm_term=P5446-60
<br><br>
Option 2 (disco ball with lights flashing at it): 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnm_IXD6tNM <br><br>

Option 3 (different flashed in a ball):
http://www.flickr.com/photos/macetech/4235536612/in/set-72157623116877654/ <br><br>

Option 4 (string of lights):
http://dingweilighting.manufacturer.globalsources.com/si/6008847873232/pdtl/Christmas-light/1064677996/70cm-LED-Christmas-Ball-Motif-Lights.htm <br><br>

Option 5 (half circle idea):
http://www.dhgate.com/product/christmas-new-led-star-crystal-ball-magic/146611479.html#s1-5-1|1767851088 <br><br>

Option 6 (design round object with ping pong balls or glue to inside of a plastic circle from option 1):
http://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2008/03/03/rgb-led-ping-pong-ball-light/ <br><br>

Option 7 (one single sphere that spins fast enough that creates circle):
http://www.zigwire.com/projects/sphere/sphere.php <br><br>

Option 8 (round ball):
http://hackaday.com/2011/10/16/we-want-this-led-ball/ <br><br>

Option 9 (lasers - but on a bigger scale and prob can use LEDs rather than lasers and have it sit on a tray thing and spin the tray):
http://www.slashgear.com/diy-laser-ball-is-21st-century-human-cat-toy-17196054/ <br><br>

Option 10:
Using a 6" diameter pipe.  You could drill holes in the exterior. You could put it 
On rollers. The rollers, could have a motor attached and the lights could go in the middle. <br><br>
