    <p class="entry"><b>February 5, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br> Came up with multiple options of how to build the mechanical design of the project that are listed below with links to the project description.<br>
    
Option 1 (use this and cut holes out of plastic -> towards idea of rotating disco ball or use a wiffle ball): http://www.nationalbuildersupply.com/progress-lighting-white-1+light-post-light-p5446+60/p12892?utm_source=shopping&utm_medium=cse&utm_campaign=Progress%20Lighting&utm_term=P5446-60
<br><br>
Option 2 (disco ball with lights flashing at it): 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnm_IXD6tNM <br><br>

Option 3 (different flashed in a ball):
http://www.flickr.com/photos/macetech/4235536612/in/set-72157623116877654/ <br><br>

Option 4 (string of lights):
http://dingweilighting.manufacturer.globalsources.com/si/6008847873232/pdtl/Christmas-light/1064677996/70cm-LED-Christmas-Ball-Motif-Lights.htm <br><br>

Option 5 (half circle idea):
http://www.dhgate.com/product/christmas-new-led-star-crystal-ball-magic/146611479.html#s1-5-1|1767851088 <br><br>

Option 6 (design round object with ping pong balls or glue to inside of a plastic circle from option 1):
http://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2008/03/03/rgb-led-ping-pong-ball-light/ <br><br>

Option 7 (one single sphere that spins fast enough that creates circle):
http://www.zigwire.com/projects/sphere/sphere.php <br><br>

Option 8 (round ball):
http://hackaday.com/2011/10/16/we-want-this-led-ball/ <br><br>

Option 9 (lasers - but on a bigger scale and prob can use LEDs rather than lasers and have it sit on a tray thing and spin the tray):
http://www.slashgear.com/diy-laser-ball-is-21st-century-human-cat-toy-17196054/ <br><br>

Option 10:
Using a 6" diameter pipe.  You could drill holes in the exterior. You could put it 
On rollers. The rollers, could have a motor attached and the lights could go in the middle. <br><br>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 6, 2014 (1.5 hour)</b>:<br>Met as a team to complete hw 3. <br> Finalized a design that we wanted for the external system. With the design, we determined that we will need to 3D print a part in order to mount the disco ball on the motor. Many major components were selected including using an LED driver to help with controlling the 3 phase LEDS. A picture of the initial design is pictured below:

    <p class="entry"><b>February 13, 2014 (8 hours)</b>:<br>Figured out how everything is going to work together, so basically configured a basic schematic. Most of the parts were switched and changed at this point. The motor that was originally selected was too powerful and too big for the design, so we decreased the size and power to  a simplier stepper motor. Due to the microcontroller needed 3.3V, the Raspberry Pi needing 5V, and the motor needing 12V one of the biggest problems was faced was how to get that all supplied to the parts correcty including using a 12V power supply. The schematic is drawn below:<br>

    <h3 id="week06">Week 06</h3>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>February 18, 2014 (4 hour)</b>:<br>Started drawing up the schematic layout on eagle. Had to create parts for the LED driver, Microcontroller, LED, and the voltage regulator. <br></p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>February 19, 2014 (3 hour)</b>:<br>Met as a team in lab and got feedback on the schematic I drew up. Originally, I was using a LM7805 and a capacitor to drop the voltage from 12V to 5V and then a voltage regulator to drop the voltage from 5V to 3.3V. However, the transistor would cause a lot of heat consumption, so the 12V to 5V will now be regulated by a switch mode with a heat sink..The schematic continued to be worked on getting most of the resistors and capacitors selected. <br></p>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 20, 2014 (8 hour)</b>:<br>Drew up and added the parts to the eagle schematic. Had to draw up the microcontroller, LED drivers, LEDS, and 2 voltage regulators. By drawing these, I had to finish figuring out the rest of the circuitry. </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>February 21,  2014 (10 hour)</b>:<br>Finished figuring out the pins and circuitry. Then drew up all the circuitry to the right pins in which the LED driver was to i/o pins and i2c pins. The rpi was connected by sdi,sdo,sclk and also had to be connected by audio to a analog pin. The motor was connected to PWM ports. The LED driver had to be connected to the SDI,SDO,SCLK as well, so a chip select was enabled since the micro is running everything it will have to switch between talking to the raspberry pi and the LCD.<br>

    <h3 id="week07">Week 07</h3>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>February 24, 2014 (1 hour)</b>:<br>Started the PCB footprint by places all the parts on the board in a manner that you can see the wires connecting.</p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>February 25, 2014 (5 hours)</b>:<br>Re-did the layouts of the LED driver, micro, and both voltage regulators so they were to size. We even took the part and layed it out on the sheet to make sure that they were the correct dimensions. While we did this, we realized that the the leads on the the layout had to be a little bit longer than specificied to make it easier for later on when we have to solder the parts onto the LED driver. Another thing that was accomplished was the values of the resistors were calculated in order to drop 5V down to 3.3V of the MAX856CSA. I also changed the power to drop 12V to 5V to a more genaric part of a LM2675 because that was what I discussed would be the best regulator with the great power being dissipated in the circuit. Added LED flashing to see the "heartbeat" of the microcontroller to make sure the I/O pins are still working. An RJ11 connector was added to the programming pins to allow the micro to be programmed. </p>
    
    <p class="entry"><b>February 26, 2014 (2 hours)</b>:<br>Kept placing and grouping parts on the PCB board layout. These items were grouped to allow for the least amount of crossing of wires and the orientation of where everything is being mounted externally that will be connected to PCB board. Once, that was finished the traces were simply layed out. <br>

    <p class="entry"><b>February 27, 2014 (4 hours)</b>:<br>Kept going with PCB layout and traces. Had to keep analog and digital ground seperate from each other until combined at the very end for the power supply. Followed Sparkfun's library for specifications on the PCB layout, so they are able to design it at the fabrcication shop correctly. Also, I changed the MAX856CSA to a LM1117 since the MAX856CSA was a step-up regulator when we needed a low dropout regulator which was the LM 1117.<br>
